History of Lower extremity Sciatica
• HISTORY:  “Pain in sciatic distribution was 
known and recorded by ancient Greek and 
Roman physicians, but was commonly 
attributed to diseases of the hip joint.” 
• “It was not until Cotugno's experiments of 
1764 (260 years ago) that leg pain was 
considered of ‘nervous’ origin and 
distinguished from pain of ‘arthritic’ origin.”
•
Lower Extremity Sciatica = condition 
where pathology (e.g. annular tear) in 
the lumbosacral region of the spine (L1 
– S1) 
•
causes dysesthesia symptoms (e.g. 
pain) in a region (lower extremities) 
remote from the site of the pathology

•
Sacral cysts, first described by Tarlov in 
1938, are occasionally found incidentally on 
lumbosacral spine MRI imaging 
•
Tarlov cysts form characteristically at the S2 
and S3 dorsal root ganglia, ballooning out 
as a result of filling with cerebrospinal fluid
•
S2 and S3 dorsal roots convey sensory 
pudendal and pelvic nerves, which innervate 
the external and internal genitalia could they 
generate the abnormal sensations 
characteristic of PGAD?
