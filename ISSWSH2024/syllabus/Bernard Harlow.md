Conclusions
• Characteristics of the vaginal microbiome, in general, are not associated 
with risk of vulvodynia.
• Antecedent yeast infections and psychosocial risk factors are associated 
with vulvodynia only in women with alpha diversity below the median.
• Uncertain whether vaginal microbiome diversity modifies the 
association between these risk factors and vulvodynia or becomes 
altered as a consequence of these associations.
• Less diverse microbiome environments might indicate changes in 
bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties or pro-inflammatory 
signaling molecules; either might result in an altered immune 
inflammatory state that may facilitate risk factors to influence 
inflammation and nerve growth proliferation or alteration.

• All women born in Sweden between 1973-1996
• By 2018, these women were 22-45 years of age
• SAMPLE – Case Control Design
• Cases: All women from the Study Population with a diagnosis 
of Vulvodynia (ICD10 code=N94.2, N76.3, N=4,787) or 
Vaginismus (ICD10 code=F52.5, N=2,063), or both (N=867) 
• Controls: Two randomly selected women per case with no 
vulvodynia or vaginismus codes (N=15,434)
