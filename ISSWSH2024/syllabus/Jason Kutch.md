Threat
Alarm
Pain
Why suspect the central nervous system (CNS)? 
•
When would removing the peripheral threat have less than 
the desired effect?
•
What if pain were distributed across the body?
•
What if CNS dysfunction predated pain onset?
•
What if CNS structure predicted surgical response?
•
How might you improve outcomes in at-risk individuals?

Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs)
•
“Coexisting pain conditions, … as recognized by National 
Institutes of Health … include, but should not be limited 
to, temporomandibular disorder (TMD), fibromyalgia 
(FM), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), vulvodynia, myalgic 
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, interstitial 
cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, endometriosis, chronic 
tension-type headache, migraine headache, and chronic 
lower back pain.”1

•
Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) 
are common in UCPPS
•
As pain becomes more widespread in UCPPS 
patients, it does not do so uniformly, but 
follows the distribution of the COPCs
•
UCPPS patients with widespread pain are 
more likely to report COPC diagnoses
•
UCPPS patients with widespread pain are 
much more likely to meet questionnaire-
based criteria for COPCs

COPCs in MAPP: neural mechanism (salience/sensorimotor)
1.
Kutch et al. 2017, Brain Signature …
•
Analysis of N=110 patients with UCPPS
•
Most consistent feature of UCPPS patients 
with widespread pain was a change in the 
functional coupling (connectivity) between 
salience network and a specific sensorimotor 
(S1/M1) region
•
Results were validated in a separate sample 
of patients with fibromyalgia but not UCPPS
•
Puzzling why changes were not distributed 
across the homunculus, will return to this 
later in the talk

COPCs in adolescents: salience/sensorimotor connectivity
•
Chelsea Kaplan and colleagues studied 
similar phenomenon in adolescents in the 
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 
(ABCD) study
•
Adolescents that developed widespread 
body pain showed similar changes in 
S1/M1-salience functional connectivity to 
MAPP
•
These connectivity changes were found 
before the report of new widespread pain

Approaches to inferring pain centralization
•
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST): May be 
useful especially if coupled with 
neuroimaging,1 but can be difficult to match to 
the patient’s chief complaint
•

but challenges in making direct inference about 
chronic pain in humans
•
Observations of fluctuations in pain intensity 
coupled with neuroimaging gives an alternative 
way to examine amplification

MAPP-II: N=492 patients with UCPPS
1.
McLain et al., in review
•
Major aim of the study was to capture 
the neural correlates of pain 
fluctuations in UCPPS
•
Here we analyze resting-state correlates 
of the overall level of genitourinary 
pain reported by the participant on the 
day of the scan
•
Self-reported pain was highly variable
•
Differences in pain were associated with 
worse physical/mental function and 
were associated with reports of “flare-
ups”


## ページ 11

Neural correlates of pain
•
Examined resting-state functional connectivity using 
two different atlases
•
Functional connectivity values were modeled with a 
longitudinal mixed effect model focusing on the fixed 
effect of pain, controlled for age, sex, site, imaging 
quality, and scan type. FDR corrected for multiple 
comparisons.
•
Connections in the sensorimotor, salience, and default 
mode networks were significantly correlated with 
pain intensity, as were connections between 
sensorimotor and salience network
•
Sensorimotor regions were focused primarily in the 
medial parts of sensorimotor cortex, consistent with 
the pelvic/bladder representation

Potential phenotypic factors of centralized pain
•
We examined 5 factors as 
potential modifiers of the 
relation between pain and 
brain connectivity:
•
Widespread pain
•
Neuropathic pain 
(painDETECT)
•
Anxiety
•
Depression
•
Catastrophizing

Pain/connectivity correlation 
modified by widespread pain
•
Functional connectivity values were modeled with a 
longitudinal mixed effect model focusing on the 
interaction of pain and modifying factor, controlled for 
age, sex, site, imaging quality, and scan type. FDR 
corrected for multiple comparisons.
•
Prescence of widespread pain modified the association 
between genitourinary pain and functional connectivity 
across many brain regions/networks
•
Modifications were most apparent in the sensorimotor 
network
•
Modifications focused in medial areas of sensorimotor 
cortex, but it spread out to encompass the entire 
sensorimotor strip

Preliminary surgical response prediction
•
Collaboration with Andrew Schrepf, Suzie As-
Sanie and colleagues at University of Michigan
•
N=70 women undergoing surgical 
hysterectomy for endometriosis
•
Average age of 40 years (range 23-50)
•
Many patients had their pelvic pain improve 
substantially, but many had a less successful 
outcome
•
We wanted to ask the question: could pre-
surgical brain structure predict surgical 
response? 


## ページ 18

Preliminary surgical response prediction
•
I previously published with Dr. Schrepf using 
Freesurfer-derived cortical surface area as an 
important sub-type classifier in chronic pelvic 
pain1. Used the same metric here
•
At each vertex, we modelled post-surgical pain 
as a function of cortical surface area 
controlled for pre-surgical pain
•
We used false discovery rate (q<0.05) to 
correct for multiple comparisons across 
vertices
•
Analysis revealed the possibility of unique 
prediction of post-surgical pain coming from 
many pain-related areas: SMA, M1, insula, 
cingulate

Direct neuromodulation
•
In preliminary sample of UCPPS 
patients (N=7), we examined how HF-
rTMS influences the S1/M1-salience 
functional connectivity
•
Seed in M1/S1
•
Examine connectivity across salience 
network mask
•
Decreased connectivity observed after 
rTMS compared to before
•
Will be looking at this in larger 
sample of well-characterized UCPPS 
patients with COPCs (R01DK121724)

Conclusions
• Widespread pain currently best clinical marker of central nervous system dysfunction – 
backed up by objective changes in brain function that are even seen in adolescents that 
develop widespread pain 
• Prediction of heterogeneity in treatment response may give more insights into central 
nervous system dysfunction.
• Direct neuromodulation with TMS as well as immersive physical activity (including VR) 
may give means to enhance responsiveness to peripheral therapies
