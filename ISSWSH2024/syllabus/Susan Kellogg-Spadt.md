HPV -RELATED CANCER STATS…
HPV infection causes about 5% of all cancers 
worldwide
HPV infection with high-risk HPV types is the 
cause of 90% of cervical and anal cancer and 
about 70% of vaginal and vulvar cancers
In general, HPV is thought to be responsible for more than 90% of anal and cervical cancers, about 70% of vaginal and vulvar cancers, and 60% of p

WHAT ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE….why are 
numbers so high
Although there are vaccines to prevent HPV infections and the cancers that result, these 
vaccines do not treat cancers caused by existing HPV infections. And for people who 
develop HPV-related cancers, more treatment options are needed.
NEW study =a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine.
Each vaccine delivers mRNA instructions for making an engineered protein called gDE7. 
Cells that take up the vaccine produce this protein, which trains the immune system to 
recognize and attack cells that have a protein from HPV-16 called E7. 
The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine protects against not only HPV 
but also certain types of cancer. Yet, study has found parents are 
reluctant to have their child vaccinated.Pediatrics 2022

◼Among these 48 sexually active women, 34 (71%) had FSFI 
scores indicating risk for sexual dysfunction.
◼Consistent with prior studies, we found low desire scores 
after treatment ASCC, with little recovery over time, 
suggesting that patients should not expect an eventual 
rebound of sexual function.

Body image is significantly disturbed by stoma formation, affecting self-
esteem and satisfaction with the self.
 Altered bodily function, with odor and sounds from the stoma bag=

 Women find a stoma difficult to accept, and partners' acceptance of it has a 
large impact on how they feel about themselves.

◼There is evidence that women who undergo surgical 
treatment for vulvar cancer or vulvar intraepithelial

dissatisfaction with partner relationship, and psychological 
difficulties. Factors associated with posttreatment sexual

Literature
Jeremie Zeitoun 1, Marjolaine Calvary 1, Claire Bonneau 1, Roman Rouzier
◼
Eleven of the 16 studies reported an impairment of quality of sex 
life, mainly related to the size of the initial lesion and the type of 
surgery performed. 
◼
+Preoperative sexual status  = + postop sex life
◼
Age, and morbidity =-- post op sex life
◼Conclusions:
◼patients should be informed about
impact on their sexual life, and 
management strategies should be 
part of their postoperative care.

◼
Psychosocial and/or psychosexual counseling should be offered to all patients 
with cancer, aiming to improve sexual response, body image, intimacy and 
relationship issues, and overall sexual functioning and satisfaction. 
◼
In women with symptoms of vaginal and/or vulvar atrophy, lubricants in 
addition to vaginal moisturizers, Low-dose vaginal estrogen, lidocaine, and 
dehydroepiandrosterone may also be considered 
◼
Women experiencing vasomotor symptoms should be offered interventions for 
symptomatic improvement, including behavioral options such as cognitive behavioral 
therapy, slow breathing and hypnosis, and medications such as venlafaxine and 
gabapentin

Management Strategies : TALK
GET SEX INTO THE 
CONVERSATION!!
Patients should talk HONESTLY about 
how sexual response may have changed 
BUT feelings for partner HAVE NOT 
CHANGED
Talk about strategies to stay connected. 


## ページ 22

Management strategies: 
evaluate pre-Ca sexuality
What was the status of the sexual life before cancer?
What was the sexual “script” and what role did cervix, anus, 
vulva ….play during intimacy? 
Who initiated sex?
Is there a “ language” for communicating about sexual 
changes? 
What has been said? What hasn’t been said?
Could benefit be gained from talking, as a couple, to a 
therapist? REFER!

Management Strategies: 
TOUCH
◼No need to LIVE WITHOUT 
INTIMACY- even if unable to have 
penetration 
◼Survivors who have regular intimacy 
(ranging from cuddling to kissing to outercourse) =LESS 
AFFECTED by sexual dysfunction 


## ページ 24

Management strategies:  
Outercourse
◼
Encourage patients to “plan intimacy scenarios” and discuss with partners acceptable 
non-penetrative sexplay options as alternatives to coitus 
◼Discuss limiting the duration of sexplay to optimize pleasure and 
decrease pain

◼Encourage use of external vibrator 
stimulation ( self or partner)

Intervention
◼Use “rocking motion” coitus vs. vigorous 
thrusting
