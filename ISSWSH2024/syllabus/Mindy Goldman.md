DISCLOSURES
• Medical Advisor - Madorra, a small tech start-up developing an ultrasound device to treat 
vaginal dryness
• Special thanks:  Melissa Boll, MS, CNM, NAMS practitioner, AASECT certified sexual counselor, 
Manager, Midi Health 


## ページ 3

CASE STUDY
• 48 year old, recent diagnosis of locally advanced hormone positive breast 
cancer, status post unilateral mastectomy, AC/T chemotherapy, radiation, now 
on ovarian suppression, letrozole and Ibrance. Menses were regular prior to 
treatment and stopped with first round of therapy. Had a previously satisfying 
sex life with her male partner of the past 10 years. She has daily hot flashes 
and night sweats, marked vaginal dryness, pain and slight bleeding with 
penetrative sex, decreased libido, poor sleep, brain fog, fatigue and some 
mood changes and comes to you for treatment options.

UNIQUE ASPECTS OF CANCER HISTORIES THAT NEED TO BE 
ASSESSED AND CONSIDERED IN TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Pelvic surgery or radiation may cause vaginal or vulvar scarring that can lead to pain with 
touch or penetration and difficulty with lubrication
Surgery, radiation or chemotherapy induced menopause can impact vaginal dryness, arousal 
and desire
Chemotherapy can induce neuropathy that influences genital sensitivity and can impair arousal
Cancer surgeries like mastectomy, pelvic surgeries, vulvectomies, ostomy creation and issues 
like lymphedema can impact body image, well being and overall sense of sexual identity


## ページ 5

UNIQUE ASPECTS OF CANCER HISTORIES THAT NEED TO 
BE ASSESSED AND CONSIDERED IN TREATMENT 
RECOMMENDATIONS
Stem cell transplants may cause graft-versus-host disease, leading to scarring, stenosis, 
ulcerations leading to sexual pain and impacts on arousal and desire
Lymph node dissection can lead to lymphedema with associated pain, impacting arousal and 
desire
Cancer treatments or cancer itself may cause pain, which can make any activity (including 
sex) difficult or impossible
Side effects of cancer medications may impact arousal and desire
Cancer-related stress, anxiety, and depression may impact overall well-being and interest in 
sex

SEXUAL FUNCTIONING IN CANCER SURVIVORS - GSM
• What is GSM?  a broad term that describes the symptoms of vaginal and vulvar 
dryness, burning, irritation, lack of lubrication, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, 
frequency, dysuria, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) that occur from 
hypoestrogenism
• “ If it hurts to be touched or have penetration it will impact overall sexual 
functioning” 


## ページ 7

SAFE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ALL SURVIVORS - GSM
Vaginal Moisturizers – maintain moisture within the vaginal tissue, meant for long-term relief and recommended 
for regular use multiple times per week, many available, lack of head-to-head comparisons, low risk
Lubricants – meant for short term use, decrease pain with friction, come in water, silicone and oil- based 
formulations. Many available, water based less irritating but don’t’ last as long as silicone or oi
WHO recommends lubes with lower osmolarity, lower pH (similar to vaginal flora) so less irritating
pH-balanced gels – particularly helpful if associated discharge and altered genital flora
Topical oils – for both vulva and vagina- penetrate thin tissue and very soothing
Lidocaine- helpful for introital pain, can be applied prior to penetrative sex (4% solution) 


## ページ 8

TREATMENT OF GSM WITH VAGINAL HORMONES 
IN CANCER SURVIVORS
• Vaginal estrogens (estradiol) felt to improve GSM by increasing blood supply, improving tone, 
lubrication, normalize pH and prevent UTI’s
• Come in cream, ring and suppository formulations. No one formulation felt superior and 
should be based on personal preference and cost
• Not thought to cause rises in systemic estradiol. No recommendation for checking estradiol 
levels
• For survivors with nonhormonal cancers AND those with gyn cancers, any formulation can be 
used


## ページ 9

WHAT ABOUT VAGINAL ESTROGEN AND BREAST 
CANCER?
• Particular concern for breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors as worse GSM 
and sexual dysfunction
• Why? Aromatase inhibitors work by shutting down all peripheral estrogen production 
so any systemic rises in estradiol might be harmful
• Limited trials show the ring and suppository formulations are safe, recommended by 
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
• Small amounts of cream formulations can be applied to the vulva and introitus safely 
to alleviate discomfort
• Not thought to impact disease recurrence except for a single observational cohort 
(Danish) study
• Small studies suggest vaginal estriol safe formulation


## ページ 10

PAIN WITH SEX – SAFE TREATMENTS FOR ALL CANCER 
SURVIVORS
• Aids and support:
• Pelvic floor PT- can assess and treat any pelvic floor dysfunction that might be 
contributing
• Vaginal dilators- can gently stretch the tissue in a nonsexual setting and help 
determine what hurts and what doesn’t hurt
• Tools like ”ohnut rings” to limit the depth of penetration. 
• Sex Therapy referrals - The American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, 
and Therapists provides information on certified sex therapists. (AASECT) 


## ページ 11

MEDICATIONS TREATMENTS FOR DYSPAREUNIA IN 
CANCER SURVIVORS
• Ospemifene – Oral SERM that is FDA approved for dyspareunia due to GSM
• Preclinical studies showing an anti-estrogen at the level of the breast
• Small studies showing no evidence of recurrence of BC but generally felt insufficient data to safely use in 
breast cancer survivors with HR+ disease
• Vaginal DHEA (Prasterone) – precursor to androgens and FDA approved for dyspareunia due to GSM
• Limited trial data in cancer survivors. 2 in breast cancer survivors and one showing small rises in total 
testosterone so lack of safety data. 
• Reasonable to use in survivors with non-hormonal cancers both - but the “oncologist is in charge” 
• Note that these are not specifically FDA approved in cancer survivors


## ページ 12

SUMMARY: ASSESSING PAINFUL SEX IN CANCER 
SURVIVORS
• Make sure to address overall pain- cancer related, surgical, etc
• Identify what hurts- the vulva, where in the vagina – entry, throughout, upper vault
• Target treatments to the areas of concern:
• Vulvar pain- use vulvar moisturizers and hormonal creams
• Vaginal pain-
• Entry pain- topical anesthetics prior to penetration, hormonal creams rubbed into the 
vestibule
• Mid pain- ensure atrophy is treated (vaginal hormones), treatments for dyspareunia
• Upper vault- consider ohnut rings to limit depth of penetration
Remember supportive services like Pelvic PT and Sex Therapy


## ページ 13

WHAT ABOUT ANDROGENS (TESTOSTERONE) IN 
CANCER SURVIVORS
• Not FDA approved for women but expert consensus groups support its use for 
improving sexual functioning (low libido) in postmenopausal women
• Concerns in HR+ breast cancer that testosterone can be “aromatized to estrogens”
• NCCN states to use with caution, particular for hormone sensitive cancers
• Dosing: need to use either compounded formulations or 1/10 of male hormone dosing
• Limited data on safety or efficacy in cancer survivors
• There are androgen receptors throughout the vulva and vagina and small amounts of 
creams can be used for pain without concern for systemic absorption (finger 
application) 


## ページ 14

FDA APPROVED DRUGS FOR LIBIDO AND CANCER 
SURVIVORS
• Flibanserin (Addyi) - nonhormonal, multi-functional serotonin agonist-antagonist that increases 
dopamine and norepinephrine and decreases serotonin
• Studies showing benefits in PMP women but needs to be used off-label
• Almost no data in cancer survivors - recent small trial presented at ASCO 2023 looked at 50 
breast cancer survivors on endocrine therapy for their breast cancer and showed improvements 
in users of Addyi in multiple domains of sexual functioning
• Bremelanotide (Vyleesi) – peptide agonist of melanocortin receptors that acts to reduce inhibitor and 
increase excitement
• No published data in cancer survivors
• Theoretically both drugs should be ok for use in cancer survivors but the “oncologist is in charge” 


## ページ 15

UNIQUE ASPECTS:  RADIATION THERAPY AND 
SEXUAL FUNCTIONING
• Frequently a part of treatment for uterine, cervical, vaginal and anorectal 
cancers
• Can result in vaginal scaring, vaginal shortening and stenosis, grading systems 
for severity
• Mechanism – thought due to mucosal damage, collagen damage, cellular death
• Risks are age, dose/volume of radiation, additional chemotherapy tissue 
sensitivity
• Can see with both brachytherapy (BT) and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT)


## ページ 16

UNIQUE ASPECTS:  RADIATION THERAPY AND 
SEXUAL FUNCTIONING
• Treatments: Dilators recommended to stretch the tissue, breakdown adhesions and improve 
patency 
• Mixed data on success of vaginal dilation, most studies show improvement in sexual 
functioning and is almost always recommended
• Lots of variation in terms of recommendation for when to initiate, frequency and instructions 
on use
• Most often initiate within 4 weeks from completion of RT, use a minimum of 3x per week, 
typically placed along the uppermost part of the vault and gently rotated, use for at least 5-
10 minutes per session
• Can see light bleeding with use
• Use with water soluble lubricant
• Some studies suggest vaginal estrogen may improve outcomes, possibly hyaluronic acid


## ページ 17

GRAFT VS HOST DISEASE
• Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) - a complication following hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) and occurs when immunocompetent donor T cells recognize host 
tissue as foreign
• Genital GVH is one of the least common areas and reported incidence from 20-50% 
post HCT
• Risk factors unclear but genital GVH most often seen with GVH elsewhere
• Higher likelihood of seeing assoc. dysplasia 
• Symptoms overlap with GSM:  vulvovaginal dryness, burning, discharge vulvar pain, and 
dyspareunia. 
• NIH grading system having do do with severity and biopsy findings
• Diagnosis based on exam and biopsy


## ページ 18

GRAFT VS HOST DISEASE
Exam findings: 
erythema and/or tenderness to palpation over 
Bartholin’s or Skene’s 
vulvar erythema, local mucosal paleness, and 
white/reticulated patches or plaques.
can look similar lichen sclerosis or lichen planus


## ページ 19

GRAFT VS HOST DISEASE
Treatments:
• Topical immunosuppression (clobetasol and vaginal steroid suppositories for 
vaginal GVH)
• Start dilator use early if vaginal involvement
• Adjuvant topical estrogen
• Rarely surgery to address scarring or to access the cervix 
• Co-management with transplant team/hematologist if planning systemic steroids
• Important to diagnose early and initiate treatment to prevent scarring/stenosis


## ページ 20

SEXUAL FUNCTIONING IN METASTATIC DISEASE
• Misconception that survivorship issues like sexual health only apply to those who are 
likely to have long life expectancies 
• Limited literature but small studies suggest that patients with advanced cancer aren’t 
asked about sexual functioning and when they are they don’t have their concerns fully 
addressed 
• Some may prioritize sexual intimacy more than sexual activity. One study showed that 
women with advanced cancer asking about sexual concerns were just offered lubricants 
and their full concerns were not addressed
• Sexual health issues should be addressed regardless of cancer stage or life expectancy 


## ページ 21

SUPPORTIVE TREATMENTS AND SEXUAL 
FUNCTIONING IN CANCER SURVIVORS
• Lifestyle changes that reduce fatigue and stress may result in positive effects 
on sexual functioning (diet, exercise, etc)
• Integrative therapies (Yoga, meditation, and mindfulness) may improve sexual 
functioning by decreasing pain and improving overall sense of well-being
• Therapy referrals for patients- individual and/or couples
• Pelvic floor PT 
• Sex Therapy

HOW TO APPROACH:  “FIX WHAT YOU CAN FIX”
• Hot flashes/night sweats – prescription alternatives to hormones (Gabapentin, Venlafaxine, 
Fezolinetant)
• Vaginal pain – OTC moisturizers, vaginal estradiol, introital lidocaine, vaginal dilators
• Decreased Libido – see response to GSM treatment, if lack of benefit consider bupropion or off-label 
Flibanserin, Bremelanotide 
• Poor sleep – see response to treating night sweats, add magnesium glycinate, ? Ashwaganda, CBT-I 
• Brain fog and fatigue- work on sleep first, discuss lifestyle- exercise recommendations, review diet, 
• Mood Changes- see if resolves with treatment of other issues, consider Venlafaxine as maybe can help 
with both 
• Additional support- consider therapy or sex therapy pending on response to treatments


## ページ 24

MOST IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY…..
• You may be the only one discussing sexual health - oncology may not bring 
up 
• There is no need for any cancer survivor to just “live with the side effects”
• There are always treatments that can be offered
• Discussions regarding sexual health should be brought up frequently 
• Intimacy is possible!
