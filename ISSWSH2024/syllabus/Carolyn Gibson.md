Learning Objectives:
After learning from the presentation, clinicians should be able to:
1. Identify common menopause symptoms and comorbidities in 
the menopause transition.
2. Recognize unique considerations for women Veterans’ 
experience of the menopause transition.
3. Recognize the importance of trauma-informed care in 
menopause management, understanding that trauma exposure 
and its sequelae (including intimate partner violence, sexual 
trauma, and posttraumatic stress disorder) are associated with 
menopause symptom burden across multiple domains.
