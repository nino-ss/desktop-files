Objectives
• Review the efficacy and safety of transdermal testosterone for generalized 
acquired hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women.
• Explore the choice/use of testosterone amongst HSDD POC recommended 
pharmacological treatment options.
• Discuss clinical indications, appropriate candidates, and target symptoms for 
treatment with off-label use of evidenced-based transdermal testosterone.
• Explain current clinical practice guidelines regarding preparation choice, dosing, 
clinical & laboratory monitoring, and follow-up when prescribing transdermal 
testosterone for women.

• HSDD is characterized by sexual and romantic avoidance, lack of initiation, low 
and changed frequency, and decreased self-esteem, distress regarding not 
wanting and concern/stress about partner’s expectations. 
• She loves her current partner x 8 years, positive non-sexual relationship, which is 
affectionate but strained due to lack of interest in romantic and sexual bonding.
• Prior 20 year combined oral contraceptive use for contraception and acne. 
• No other contributing medical, medication, substance-related, or psychosocial 
factors contributing to HSDD (based on DSDS questionnaire responses and follow-
up clinical interview)
• Total Testosterone 7.9 ng/dl (lowest quartile of reference range), SHBG 85 
nmol/L, TSH 2.29 ml/UL
Case Scenario – “Denise”

Hypoactive Sexual Desire –Helen Singer Kaplan MD, PhD 
• Physiology of sexual desire as yet has not been delineated precisely…governed by neural 
circuits that pass through special centers. 
• These circuits are usually responsive to specific neural transmitters. Presumably, sexual 
desire originates in circuits in the limbic brain…hypothalamus. 
• It appears that testosterone is necessary for the functioning of the sexual appetite 
centers in females. 
• This general concept is supported by clinical evidence that suggests that central nervous 
system depression, use of sedatives and narcotics, debilitating illness, etc. impair sex 
drive on a physical basis. 
• Similarly, any illness or drug that interferes with proper levels of testosterone, or with 
the estrogen-testosterone ratio, can and will also diminish sexual desire.
Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Vol. 3, No. 1, Spring 1977

Testosterone Treatment:  Kaplan and Owett
• Every patient who received replacement was pleased by rapid return of her sexual 
feelings. “It’s a miracle” and “I couldn’t live without my testosterone [injections]”
• Fortunately, relatively low levels of testosterone that effectively restore and 
maintain female libido do not generally result in virilization of peripheral organs.
• Neurons that make up the sexual motivation centers of the female brain require 
only relatively small amounts of circulating T.
• “Physiologically correct” dose must result in a blood level that is high enough to 
maintain sexual responsiveness but too low to result in virilization. 
• “Therapeutic window” at which beneficial effects on female libido can be 
achieved without incurring unwelcome masculinizing side effects is usually 
attained at 1/10th of the dose that is administered to hypogonadal men.
• Urged combination parenteral T replacement and psychosexual counseling

In women with distressing loss of sexual desire, the 3 active blinded medications that 
have been tested extensively (TTS, oral flibanserin, sub cutaneous bremelanotide) 
were each associated with large treatment effect sizes, while placebo was associated 
with a moderate treatment effect size.

• International panel concluded only evidence-based indication for testosterone 
therapy for women is for treatment of HSDD
• Data supports moderate therapeutic effect in postmenopausal women 
• Meta-analyses shows no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone 
use, with caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from studies
• Safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.
• Diagnosis of HSDD involves full clinical assessment and that other factors 
contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is 
initiated…guided by available diagnostic criteria (ISSWSH, ICD 11)
• A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD (NO CUTOFF).

• Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood 
concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal 
physiological concentrations [no biological rationale for higher levels]
• As no approved female product is approved by a national regulatory body, 
male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses and blood 
testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. 
• The panel recommended against use of compounded testosterone.
• The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone 
therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated 
specifically for women [does not preclude testing of any formulation].

• 46 reports of 36 randomized controlled trials of 8480 participants
• Testosterone significantly increased sexual function, including satisfactory 
sexual event frequency, desire, arousal, orgasm, and self-image, and 
reduced distress in postmenopausal women. 
• Associated with greater likelihood of reporting acne and hair growth 
• No serious adverse events (breast, intermediate CV endpoints, uterus)
• Administration via non-oral routes (transdermal application) preferred 
because of neutral lipid profile.

Testosterone treatment of naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with 
HSDD, with/or without concurrent estrogen therapy:
Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone 
concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual 
function above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy  of an average of one 
SSE/month, and increases in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, 
orgasmic function, pleasure, and sexual responsiveness, with a reduction in 
sexual concerns including sexual distress (Level I, Grade A).

ISSWSH CPG for Systemic  Testosterone
• Purpose: To provide specific guidelines regarding identification of patients, 
laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in the 
consideration of testosterone therapy for HSDD in women.
• The Global Position Statement was/is the most comprehensive, evidence-based 
guideline to date, superseding all previous guidelines; where guidance is not 
provided, previously published guidelines were reviewed and referenced.
• Updated HSDD POC (in progress) will provide any new available efficacy and 
safety data and any change in evidenced-based management recommendations. 
*No industry funding

ISSWSH CPG for T Use: Key Messages
• Androgens, including testosterone, are essential hormones for 
development and maintenance of female sexual anatomy and physiology 
and modulation of sexual behavior. 
• Testosterone has many physiological and pathophysiological actions in 
women, directly through its cell specific receptor, by non-receptor 
mediated actions, and by conversion to 5a-DHT and estrogens.
• There is no serum testosterone level for diagnosis of HSDD or for use as 
a treatment target [no CUT OFF/POINT].
• Total serum testosterone concentration is the best practical assay. 


## ページ 23

ISSWSH CPG for T Use: Key Messages
• Proper dosing should attain and maintain testosterone levels in the 
premenopausal physiological range. 
• If an approved female formulation is not available, one-tenth of a standard 
male dose of 1% transdermal testosterone or about 300 mcg/day can 
usually achieve the normal premenopausal physiological range.
• Compounded testosterone, pellets, IM injections, and oral formulations 
are not recommended.
• Additional testing and alternative strategies may be required to assess 
failure to respond to typical testosterone treatment, particularly when 
testosterone or SHBG levels are high.

•
The physiology of androgens is complex due to their conversion in tissues and possible 
intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues.
•
Androgenic effects vary according to individual variations in amount and activity of 
enzymes 5-reductase and aromatase and individual differences in androgen-receptor 
response. 
•
Measurement of serum testosterone does not provide specific measure of androgen 
tissue exposure or action.
•
Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor (AR)/non-genomic 
androgenic action, or by reduction to the more potent androgen 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites.

ISSWSH CPG Rationale for Testosterone Therapy:  
Although no testosterone serum concentration correlates with the presence or absence 
of HSDD or its severity, there is a loose correlation between testosterone concentration 
while undergoing treatment and its benefits for improving sexual dysfunction.
There is no blood level that is a treatment goal for testosterone therapy, as serum 
concentrations do not predict treatment efficacy. 
Main reasons to measure testosterone: 
(1) to exclude women with midrange to high values (according to assay used) that 
suggest against androgen levels being associated with patient’s symptoms
(2) to monitor testosterone therapy to ensure against supraphysiological values and 
associated androgen excess side effects

• *Use TOTAL TESTOSTERONE - evidence regarding free T as biologically active 
fraction is lacking. 
• Total testosterone measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas 
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (LC/GC-MS/MS).
• Direct assays for measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable 
in female range.
• Direct assays are appropriate to exclude high baseline concentrations and to 
exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment.

Treatment Recommendations Should Follow 
Biopsychosocial Model
Davis, Baber, Panay et al Climacteric, Maturitas, J Sex Med, JCEM; ePub 2/9/2019 
Testosterone therapy should only be initiated after a full biopsychosocial evaluation and 
appropriate management of other conditions that may contribute to diminished desire.
•
Treatments should follow a biopsychosocial model and include pharmacologic options 
(hormonal and nonhormonal agents), psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that 
combine pharmacologic with nonpharmacologic treatments. 
•
Even when the primary etiology is biological, symptoms may be maintained or 
exacerbated by psychosocial and interpersonal factors that have been the consequence 
of a biologically based female sexual dysfunction. 
•
When the etiology of generalized, acquired HSDD appears to be multifactorial without 
a predominant factor identified, pharmacologic treatment can be considered. 
•
Combination therapy (psychological and pharmacologic therapy) may be beneficial in all 
circumstances.

Who to Treat
• Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy only for 
postmenopausal women, the ISSWSH POC for HSDD and ISSWSH T CPG include 
women in the late reproductive years, a recommendation supported by the 
physiology of decline in androgens and efficacy data. 
• Insufficient data to recommend use of testosterone in premenopausal women 
for treatment of sexual function, including women on COCs.
– Stopping COCs is a modifiable factor. 
• Assessment and management of women with premature ovarian insufficiency 
(less than age 40 years) and early menopause (less than age 45 years) should be 
the same as for any other postmenopausal woman presenting with HSDD.
• Transdermal testosterone has not been studied for the FSIAD indication in any 
RCT/other clinical trial.

•
Compounded “bioidentical” testosterone therapy cannot be recommended due to 
the lack of evidence for efficacy and safety, unless an authorized equivalent 
preparation is not available. 
•
If a compounded product is needed, the compounding pharmacy should be 
compliant with purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) to meet industry standards for quality and safety. 
•
Systemic DHEA is not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual 
function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and not 
recommended for women with HSDD.
•
In the absence of vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal DHEA has not been tested and thus 
cannot be recommended.

Key Take Home Points
• Transdermal testosterone is moderately effective for HSDD in late 
reproductive age and post-menopausal women.
• Maintain total testosterone levels in the physiological premenopausal 
range to diminish adverse events and optimize CNS and peripheral sexual 
responses.  
• If an approved female formulation is not available, 1/10th of a standard 
male dose of 1% transdermal testosterone (300 mcg/day) can usually 
achieve the normal premenopausal physiological range.
• Compounded testosterone, pellets, IM injections, and oral formulations are 
not recommended.
