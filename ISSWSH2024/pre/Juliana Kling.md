Learning Objectives
•Recognize the epidemiology and type of 
distressing sexual problems in women 
•Discuss recommendations for identification of 
sexual problems in women using the ISSWSH 
process of care
•Develop an understanding and plan for 
screening, education, management and referral 
for women with sexual problems through a case 
example
The most 
fundamental 
recommendation 
of the POC is 
simply to ask 
about sexual 
satisfaction, 
concerns or 
problems.

Myth vs. Truth: Patients don’t want to talk about sex

health
•90 % prefer we initiate the topic

& 31% of

Meanwhile, clinicians are thinking…
Korenman, SG,1998, Brokeman, CPM et al, 1994, Eid JF et al, 2001, Baum, N et al. 1998. 
What if it 
embarrasses 
my patient to 
ask?
I’m not sure 
if I’ll know 
how to treat 
their issue
I never learned 
about this in 
medical school
We have to first 
discuss their 
hypertension, 
immunizations, 
knee pain, 
mammogram, etc… 
(in 20 minutes!)
I’m not 
familiar with 
any 
treatments 


## ページ 10

A simple place to start: Screen all women
• Simple, direct language
• “just ask,” ubiquity statement screen, asking in context of relationship or basic 
assessment of sexual functioning 
• Compassion, normalizing statement
• Declare lack of embarrassment
• Ensure confidentiality
• Avoid judgement & assumptions
“Do you have any sexual health concerns? I 
ask all my patient this because its an 
important aspect of health. Anything you tell 
me is confidential.”

Case cont…28 yo computer engineer 
• She has noticed she’s not interested in sex like before 
and it is causing her distress
• Started an antidepressant (SSRI) about 6 months ago 
for anxiety
• She is healthy and denies any other sexual problems 
“What sexual health concerns do you have? 
Anything you tell me is confidential.”

1. Elicit the story
•Tell me more about your symptoms? 
•How has this impacted your life?
2. Name & (Re) Frame attention to the 
Sexual problem or concern 
“It seems to me that in addition to your 
decreased interest in sex, what you’ve just told 
me about your concern for your orgasm is just 
as important and worthy of attention.”

Assessment & 
Treatment 
Where the beginning of 
treatment starts for many 
women 
• Powerful & healing and 
amplified when the clinician 
reflects her or his 
understanding of the patient’s 
life and efforts in words. 
• “I am impressed with how 
committed you are to 
addressing your sexual health 
problem despite how difficult 
that is.” 
• “You are determined to try 
and solve this problem.”
• If refer, set it up
“I consider sexual health 
to be important to your 
overall health…I have a 
colleague who specializes 
in treating this.”
Let’s assess & 
treat Ronda

Defining Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD)
• Must cause significant distress or interpersonal difficulty to be a 
dysfunction 
• Not better account for by another disorder (e.g. depression), medical 
condition (e.g. GSM) or substance (e.g. alcohol)
• Persist for a minimum of 3 months, with at least 75% of sexual 
experiences
• Defined by
• Onset →lifelong vs. acquired
• Context →generalized vs. situational
• Characteristics →mild, moderate or severe AND duration (longer than 
6 months)

Case continued…
• Basic Assessment →based on sexual response domains
• Low sexual desire
• Difficulty with sexual arousal
• Difficulty with orgasm
• Sexual pain/genitopelvic pain penetration dysfunction
• Relationship problems
•Empathetically helping delineate the problem 
can be therapeutic and help your patient start to 
solve the problem 
You can provide basic education:
-
Medication adverse sexual effects
-
Sexual function changes due to menopause
-
Role of lubricants & moisturizers

Sexual Dysfunction in Transgender People 
• Limited research and no standard diagnostic criteria
• Both Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy (GAHT) and Gender Affirming surgery (GAS) may 
modify the sexual response physiology via multiple mechanisms, but the impact on overall 
sexual health is not well understood
• Systematic review in 2021 of transgender women and men showed:
• increase in sexual desire after GAHT (testosterone) in transgender men, which increased within 
months of initiation of treatment. Route didn’t matter. 
• Studies on sexual desire after GAS in trans men were small and results mixed
• Sexual satisfaction demonstrated improvement after GAHT/GAS for trans men
• Reduction in sexual desire was noted after GAHT for transgender women, but not distressing →
transient and ultimately returned to baseline
• Orchiectomy decreased desire, but vaginoplasty and breast augmentation did not impact sexual 
desire for transgender women, and overall positive affect on sexual satisfaction after GAS
• Studies in transgender women found mixed results regarding orgasm after GAHT and GAS
• Pain appeared to occur more commonly in transgender women with a neovagina compared to 
those without a neovagina
• When compared to cisgender women, transgender women scored lower overall on the Female 
Sexual Function Index (FSFI), indicating poorer sexual function

Case continued: Ronda
• Diagnosis: Female orgasm 
disorder caused by her SSRI, with 
resultant impact on desire
• Options
• Augmentation therapy with 
mirtazapine or bupropion
• Behavioral therapies 
• Exercise, vibratory stimulation
• Dose reduction or brief drug 
holiday
• Switch antidepressants
• Mirtazapine or bupropion (not 
as beneficial for anxiety)
Risk of sexual side 
effects with 
antidepressants is ~ 
40%
Arousal 80%
Desire 72%
Orgasm 42%

In Summary 
•Sexual problems are common in cisgender 
women
•Clinicians should feel empowered to identify 
sexual problems in women and provide basic 
management strategies
•Consider biological, psychological, 
sociocultural and relationship factors that 
may play a role 
•Goal is to provide education, management and 
referral when appropriate for women with 
sexual concerns/problems
