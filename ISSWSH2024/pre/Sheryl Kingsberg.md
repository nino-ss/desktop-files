What IS Desire?
In the Eye of the Beholder
Sexual desire is a complex interplay of psychological, physiological, and emotional 
components influenced by external factors. Desire may be described as the interest in, 
thoughts/fantasies about, and the positive anticipation of or appetite for a sexual activity

HSDD is the persistent or recurrent absence of sexual thoughts or 
fantasies and/or lack of desire for sexual activity that is associated 
with marked personal distress
Any of the following for a minimum of 6 months:
•Lack of motivation for sexual activity manifested by either:
• Reduced or absent spontaneous desire 
OR
• Reduced or absent responsive desire to erotic cues and 
stimulation or inability to maintain desire
•Loss of desire to initiate or participate, including behavioral 
responses such as avoidance, not secondary to a sexual pain 
disorder
What is NOT Desire
Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) 
Clinically significant 
personal distress 
(includes frustration, grief, 
incompetence, loss, sorrow, 
or worry)
If no distress-consider 
Asexuality which is not a 
dysfunction

What’s a “normal” amount of desire as expressed 
as sexual activity/frequency?

Difficult to answer. The “normal” frequency of sex = frequency that 
two partners agree works best for them. For some, that might mean 
having sex several times a day/week/month/year.

As long as both partners are satisfied, no right or wrong answer

One study: 60%-70% of men and women stated weekly or more

Also consider quality vs. quantity

It Takes Two To Tango
There is a dynamic and reciprocal relationship of one 
partner’s sexual function, sexual satisfaction, physical and 
mental health to the other partner’s sexual health and 
satisfaction
The partner’s role as a precipitating or maintaining factor has 
been overshadowed  by focusing on individual medical, 
psychological, or interpersonal factors upon sexual function
Issues such as power/control dynamics, unrealistic 
expectations or reactions from a partner about sex, 
strategies of ‘trying to initiate sex’

• Sex therapy is a specialized form of psychotherapy that draws on an array of 
behavioral interventions known to effectively treat sexual dysfunction
• Affectual awareness that strives for recognition of positive and negative 
emotions related to sexual interaction and desire
• Reframing cognitive factors and distracting thoughts
• Offering insight and understanding to the genesis of the problem
• Alters maladaptive behaviors
• Improve communication between partners (e.g. desire discrepancy)
• Sexual function is the focus (not underlying psychopathology)
• Usually 5-20 sessions, includes between-session homework

• Evidence that supportive sex education improves desire
• May be that it provides normalization and validation and increased self-
understanding (Brotto et.  Al) 
• May also be due to an increase in self-compassion (Brotto et al.)
• Psychoeducation (e.g., about sexual response, prevalence, contributing factors 
to low desire)

• Encourages increased attention to sexual cues
• Encourages intentional awareness of bodily sensations

• Usually around 8-12 sessions (group or individual)
• Potential mechanisms: reduces depressive symptoms and self-criticism and increases 
mindfulness and interoception and self-compassion (Brotto et a)
• neuroplastic changes in the structure and function of the brain regions involved in the 
regulation of attention, emotion and self awareness
• Sessions include:
• Mindfulness practice (e.g., body awareness, body scan, mindfulness of thoughts and 
movement, non-masturbatory genital self-stimulation) (continued at home practice)
• Instructions for at-home practice of mindfulness after exposure to body touch or 
interactions with stimulus (e.g., vibrator, sexual content)
• Psychoeducation (e.g., about sexual response, prevalence, contributing factors to low 
desire)

• Alter self-identity as non-sexual
• Self-Perception Theory
• People make attributions about their own attitudes by relying on 
observations of external behaviors (Bem, 1965)
• Teach couple to compromise desire discrepancy
• Describe Wundt's schema of sensory affect 
• Increases of stimulus intensity above threshold are felt as 
increasingly pleasant up to a peak value beyond which 
pleasantness falls off through indifference to increasing 
unpleasantness.
