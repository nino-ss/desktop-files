At the end of this 35 minute talk, you should be able to 
1. Identify the main categories of sexual and genitopelvic pain 
disorders. 
2. Use the presented framework to organize and interpret data from 
an evaluation to accurately diagnose a patient with a condition. 
3. Identify appropriate treatment options for patients with 
genitopelvic pain conditions.

## ページ 6

VULVODYNIA = persistent pain,
at least 3 months duration 
with no clear cause
Bornstein, et al 2016, JSM
Most commonly:
Musculoskeletal 
Hormonal
Nerve related


## ページ 7

• “EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL….”
• WHO: Know their context for sexual function (Partners? Trauma/Abuse? 
Religion? Culture?)
• WHAT: Describe the pain (burning, itching, rawness, cutting, tearing, 
throbbing, aching, heaviness)
• WHERE: Is it on the outside, at the entrance, or deeper inside?
• WHEN: Get a very detailed timeline (particularly in regard to timing of pain 
with potential causes such as pills, infections, injuries, or births). 
• WHY: That’s next…
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY


## ページ 8

• Attitudes about sex/genitals
• Trauma history (big AND little T, physical and emotional/verbal)
• Anxiety/depression/OCD
• Anxious tendencies/ Type A personality

## ページ 9

COMPREHENSIVE PELVIC EXAM 
CONSENT
• "Offer" an exam
• Describe your plan
• Empower autonomy
• Is a speculum needed?

Mirror mirror, in your hand!


## ページ 11

• Divide it in half
• Many diagnoses are 
differentiated by eliciting pain 
on anterior vs posterior half.
• Posterior only = muscle
• Anterior + posterior = 
hormone/nerve
The Vestibule


## ページ 12

“Q Tip Test”


## ページ 13

- Make sure to get baseline in remote areas such as inner thighs to 
allow patient to feel nonpainful touch.
- I tend to use more of a gentle swipe motion rather than a poke or 
touch (exception being when touching the posterior vestibule where 
the muscle insertion sites are)
- Use lots of anatomically correct language and a mirror to teach the 
patient about her anatomy.  
- Always distinguish between normal “scratchy/sensitive” sensations 
and “PAIN” – descriptors are helpful
- Burning, cutting, sharp, knife like, needles, stinging, hot, etc. 
Q Tip Test (moistened with water or gel!)

DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
HIGH YIELD
Wet mount 
(alternative: pH and whiff)
MAYBE

vagina)
•
Pelvic floor physical therapy


## ページ 22

Lichen Sclerosus
• Autoimmune condition of the skin
• Commonly in anogenital areas of women (but can also affect men)
• Characterized by severe inflammation, sclerotic tissue formation, and 
changes in vulvar architecture
• Symptoms include hypopigmentation, tearing, itching, fissures/pain, 
pain with vaginal penetration
• Increased risk of other autoimmune conditions:
• Autoimmune thyroid diseases (Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves’ disease), 
alopecia areata, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia 
• Can affect vulvas of ANY age
• Increased (4-6%) risk of vulvar carcinoma if not optimally treated

Pro tips for vestibulodynia
• Start ET gel twice per day.
• Counsel patient’s on timeline (slight change by 6 weeks, significant 
improvement by 3 months)
• Consider delaying physical therapy until active vulvar issue has been 
addressed an dis not contributing to pain. 
• Wean down once pain is significantly better, 2x per week for 
maintenance longer term. Total recommended duration is unknown. 
• Check a total T 6-12 weeks after starting gel to ensure safe dosing. 


## ページ 28

What about neuroproliferative? 
• Must figure out timeline to determine how likely they have either
• Acquired - triggered by chronic infection or irritant exposure
• Congenital – born with increased density of C afferent nociceptors
• Vestibular tissue can appear erythematous but not always.

1. Taking our pain seriously can make all the difference.
“We've heard thousands of stories from patients whose pain was dismissed. They've been told things 
like, 
"you must have repressed sexual trauma," 
"it's a mental block, there's nothing causing your pain," 
"you're too young to have Lichen Sclerosus, only older women have that," 
"sometimes sex is painful and that's normal," 
"are you sure you're attracted to your husband?," 
"does your boyfriend know what he's doing?," 
"it could be because you're bisexual," 
"have you tried drinking some wine before sex?"...etc. 
As a provider, your words have a huge impact. Patients remember these comments, and, often, they 
don't seek care after they've been told something like this. Many of us even avoid necessary pap 
smears and exams because of being dismissed in the past. Believing that our pain is real, 
demonstrating curiosity about our experience and trying to understand how it's impacting us can 
make a huge impact on a patient's life.”
A call to action from OUR patients


## ページ 41

2. It’s okay not to know the answers.
“We, as patients, know that there are gaps in education, training, 
and research on these conditions -- and we don't expect our 
medical providers to have all of the answers. We really 
appreciate when medical providers are honest with us. 
Usually, we're looking for our medical providers to be 
partners with us in figuring out what's going on and, if 
necessary, refer us to someone who has more expertise in 
treating these conditions”


## ページ 42

3. Ask proactively about patients' symptoms, screen for pain 
with intercourse at check-up appointments.
“Many patients don't realize that their pain is valid and that they 
need and deserve medical attention and care. Pain with sex is 
normalized in such a way in our society that many patients don't 
bring it up proactively with their doctors, and/or don't know how 
to talk about it. If you ask your patients about their symptoms, 
you may save the patient years of pushing through the pain, 
consenting to sex that causes excruciating pain, and working 
through the courage to bring it up themselves.”


## ページ 43

4. Help us close the gaps in access to care.
“It is extremely difficult for patients to find medical providers who 
treat these conditions who take insurance and are in a hospital 
network. A University of Minnesota study found that over a third 
of vestibulodynia patients went to more than 15 doctor 
appointments before getting an accurate diagnosis. The 
majority of patients can't afford to see an out-of-network 
specialist or provider. You can help us make this care more 
accessible by seeking out the education and tools so that you 
can treat patients yourself (rather than needing to refer to a 
specialist) and by educating your colleagues!”


## ページ 44

• LISTEN to your patient and THINK CRITICALLY when your knee-jerk 
reaction is disbelief, dismissive, or minimizing
• BE CREATIVE when making a plan with a patient. Each individual has 
unique needs and circumstances
• SEXUAL/GENITOPELVIC PAIN IS MULTISYSTEM AND MULTIDISIPLINARY
• Biopsychosocial!
• Use your algorithms to help guide diagnosis
• Refer to colleagues when needed
Take Aways
