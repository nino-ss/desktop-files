(sexual thoughts, fantasies)
OR
–Reduced or absent responsive desire to 
erotic cues and stimulation or inability to 
maintain desire
Loss of desire to initiate or participate, including 
behavioral responses such as avoidance, not 
secondary to a sexual pain disorder

CNS-acting Agents for HSDD
Flibanserin (2015), Bremelanotide (2019)


## ページ 12

Flibanserin
• Mixed post-synaptic 5HT1A agonist and 5HT2A 
antagonist
• Exact mechanism of action in treating HSDD is unknown
• Activity at dopamine D4 receptors and moderate 
affinity for 5HT2B and 5HT2C receptors
• Region-specific elevations in dopamine/norepinephrine 
offset inhibitory serotonergic activity resulting in 
increased desire pathways
• Serotonin = sexual satiety signal


## ページ 14

Flibanserin Serotonin Receptor Activity
• Centrally-acting central nervous system agent, thought to act mainly on 
serotonin receptors in the brain.
• 5HT1A agonists could have pro-sexual effects
• 5HT2A antagonists could have pro-sexual effects

5-HT1A
5-HT2A


## ページ 15

Flibanserin
• Improves multiple domains (FSFI)
• Decreases distress associated with FSD (FSDS-DAO)
• FDA-approved for generalized HSDD in premenopausal
women not caused by:
• Medical or psychiatric condition
• Relationship problems
• Effects of a medication/drug
• Not Viagra (not performance enhancing)
• Not YET indicated for postmenopausal women & men
• Flibanserin is contraindicated:
• With concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors
• In patients with hepatic impairment

Effects of Alcohol Administered with Flibanserin in Healthy Premenopausal 
Women
•
In this large, 7-treatment, 12-sequence, crossover study, administration of alcohol with flibanserin was not associated with an increased risk of 
hypotension and syncope
•
1 Subject in the ADDYI+ 0.4 g/kg EtOHgroup experienced hypotension
•
The adverse event profile for concomitant administration of mild (0.2 g/kg) or moderate (0.4 g/kg) quantities of ethanol with flibanserin was 
similar to that of flibanserin alone
•
Increased drowsiness following administration of flibanserin (with or without ethanol) in this study supports the recommended (bedtime) 
dosing

MOA: Increased Overall and Regional Blood Flow
Blood flow is vital to sexual comfort and pleasure.
• Lower levels of estrogen cause a decrease in blood flow to the vagina.
• Lack of blood flow to the genital areas can lead to:
• Reduced sensitivity to touch
• Reduced receptivity to physical arousal
• Reduced vaginal lubrication
• Can ultimately lead to painful or uncomfortable intercourse and reduced sexual 
desire.
• Sexual dysfunction is common in peri and post-menopausal women and may 
be caused by the decline in nitric oxide and estrogen levels, both strong 
vasodilators.
[Berman 2005]


## ページ 37

L arginine and L Citruline
• During female sexual response, Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) is
produced, an enzyme that converts arginine and citrulline into nitric oxide
(NO).
• This increase in eNOS-NO leads to vasodilation, transudation (lubrication), 
and relaxation of the smooth muscle cells in the vagina.3
• eNOS activity is important for healthy sexual function, but it can decrease 
with age and hormonal changes.
• Pycnogenol and Rosvita: strong herbal antioxidants, prevent the degradation 
of nitric oxide by inhibiting free radicals, leading to improvement of 
endothelial function.
