**Age-related Treatment Continuation Rates in Female Patients with Urinary Frequency: A Retrospective Cohort Study**

## Abstract

### Background and Objectives

Female lower urinary tract symptoms significantly impact quality of life but are often underestimated as non-life-threatening conditions. This perception, combined with embarrassment regarding urological consultation, creates treatment continuation barriers. This study aimed to clarify age-related treatment continuation rates in female patients with urinary frequency.

### Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 110 female patients aged 20-80 years presenting with urinary frequency between October 2023 and September 2024. Patients were categorized into young (20-39 years, n=22), middle-aged (40-59 years, n=55), and elderly (60-80 years, n=33) groups. Treatment continuation was defined as follow-up visits within 1.5 times prescribed medication duration. Primary endpoints were continuation rates at 3, 6, and 12 months.

### Results

Twelve-month continuation rates were 9.1% (young), 40.0% (middle-aged), and 33.3% (elderly). Very early discontinuation within 3 months occurred in 70.0% of young patients versus 29.1% and 30.3% in middle-aged and elderly groups, respectively. Among discontinuation cases, 65% involved extremely early cessation after 1-2 visits, predominantly self-discontinuation with unknown outcomes. Young age (HR 3.21) was an independent risk factor for discontinuation.

### Conclusions

Treatment continuation rates vary dramatically by age, with young patients showing extremely poor continuation (9.1% at 12 months) and 70% discontinuing within 3 months. Beyond traditional barriers, unrealistic treatment expectations appear crucial. Age-specific patient education emphasizing gradual treatment response and appropriate expectation setting may improve outcomes.
