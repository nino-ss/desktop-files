1. Define the role of testosterone in the sexual function and physiology 
of people born with ovaries.
2. Review the guidelines for use of testosterone for treatment of 
hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)
3. Identify appropriate candidates for testosterone therapy and 
demonstrate how to safely prescribe testosterone and monitor 
patients.
Objectives


## ページ 4

Patient: Mary, a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman.
Chief Complaint: Low libido and decreased sexual satisfaction for the past two 
years.
History: Mary experienced natural menopause at age 51. Since then, she has 
noticed a gradual decline in sexual desire, leading to frustration and strain in her 
relationship. She reports no pain during intercourse but feels less responsive to 
sexual stimuli. She has no history of hormone-sensitive cancers or cardiovascular 
disease.
Medical History:
●Hypertension (controlled with medication)
●No history of depression or anxiety
●Estradiol patch 0.1mg/24 hour patch for vasomotor symptoms, Mirena IUD
Case example


## ページ 5

Evaluation:
●
Normal physical exam and pelvic examination
●
Bloodwork: Normal thyroid function and blood glucose; low-normal free testosterone levels. 
Normal lipid levels and liver function
Management Plan:
1. Lifestyle Counseling: Education on the effects of menopause on sexual health and the role of 
stress and relationship dynamics.
2. Testosterone Therapy Consideration: Discussed the option of low-dose transdermal 
testosterone cream (off-label in some regions) with shared decision-making.
3. Monitoring Plan: Initiated a three-month trial of testosterone cream with follow-up to monitor 
symptom improvement, androgenic side effects (e.g., acne, hair growth), and metabolic markers.
Outcome: After three months, Mary reports a noticeable increase in sexual desire and improved 
intimacy with no significant side effects. Regular monitoring continues for safety and efficacy.

Global 
Statement: 
Summary 
and Key 
Messages
• International panel concluded only evidence-based indication for 
testosterone therapy for women is for treatment of HSDD.
• Data supports moderate therapeutic effect in postmenopausal 
women.
• Meta-analyses shows no severe adverse events during 
physiological testosterone use, with caveat that women at high 
cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations.
• Safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been 
established.
• Diagnosis of HSDD involves full clinical assessment and that other 
factors contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed 
before testosterone therapy is initiated…guided by available 
diagnostic criteria (ISSWSH or ICD 11).
• A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose 
HSDD (NO CUTOFF).


## ページ 26

• Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood 
concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal 
physiological concentrations.
• As no approved female product is approved by a national regulatory 
body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses and 
blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly.
• The panel recommended against use of compounded testosterone 
(no pellets, no injectables!!!!)
--The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into 
testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of 
products indicated specifically for women.
Global Statement: Summary and Key Messages
•.


## ページ 27

• Proper dosing should attain and maintain testosterone levels in the 
premenopausal physiological range.
• If an approved female formulation is not available, one-tenth of a 
standard male dose of 1% transdermal testosterone or about 300 
mcg/day can usually achieve the normal premenopausal physiological 
range.
• Additional testing and alternative strategies may be required to 
assess failure to respond to typical testosterone treatment, 
particularly when testosterone or SHBG levels are high.

• Baseline total testosterone should be measured before initiating therapy 
with repeat level in 3–6 weeks.
• Check T levels 6 weeks after dose increase and 2-3 weeks after 
supraphysiological level and dose decrease.
• Monitor for clinical response, assess for signs of androgen excess and 
decrease dose if side effects occur.
• Check serum total testosterone level every 4-6 months to screen for 
overuse and inherent androgenic consequences.
• If no benefit by 6 months, treatment should be ceased.
• If testosterone therapy results in improvement of HSDD, consider 
continuing for 6–12 months and then taking a drug holiday to see if further 
treatment is still required.
• In most cases, ongoing testosterone therapy is needed to maintain the 
improvement in HSDD. 
Testosterone Therapy Follow -up


## ページ 36

• Measurement of SHBG and assessing Free T may contribute to 
understanding lack of response.
• Women whose blood levels are in physiologic range and not experiencing 
improvement of HSDD symptoms
• Healthy women, high dose oral estrogens, estrogen-containing hormonal 
contraceptives, untreated hyper- and hypothyroidism, thyroid replacement
• Androgenic side effects may occur despite standard dosing or normal 
levels of total testosterone or both.
• May occur with low concentrations of SHBG, associated with type 2 diabetes, 
metabolic syndrome, and/or obesity
Testosterone Monitoring and Follow up


## ページ 37

• Total testosterone measured with high accuracy and reproducibility 
using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry 
assays (LC/GC-MS/MS).
• Direct assays for measurement of total and free testosterone are 
highly unreliable in the female range.
• Direct assays are appropriate to exclude high baseline concentrations 
and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during 
treatment.
*Use TOTAL TESTOSTERONE – evidence regarding free T as biologically 
active fraction is lacking.
Testosterone Measurements


## ページ 38

• Compounded ‘bioidentical’ testosterone therapy cannot be 
recommended due to the lack of evidence for efficacy and safety, 
unless an authorized equivalent preparation is not available (Expert 
opinion).
• If a compounded product is needed, the compounding pharmacy 
should be compliant with purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 
(API) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) to meet industry 
standards for quality and safety.
• Systemic DHEA is not associated with significant improvement in 
libido or sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal 
adrenal function and not recommended for women with HSDD (Level 
IA, Grade A).
Other Treatment Considerations


## ページ 39

• Annual breast and pelvic exams
• Annual mammography
• Evaluation of abnormal bleeding
• Evaluation for acne, hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, voice changes, clitoromegaly
• Lipid profile, LFTs, CBC - baseline, 6 mos, annually
• Use for > 6 months contingent on clear improvement and absence of adverse 
events
Testosterone Clinical and Lab Monitoring 


## ページ 40

• Short answer, the current data say YES in most 
cases
• Need long term safety data
• Cardiovascular/breast cancer: No increased risk 
(Agrawal 2024)
• Androgenic side effects: acne and increased hair 
growth, generally mild (Al-Imari 2012.)
• Metabolic side effects (Davis 2019)- Decrease 
HDL
But is it safe?!


## ページ 41

• 46 reports of 36 randomized controlled trials of 8,480 participants
• Testosterone significantly increased sexual function, including 
satisfactory sexual event frequency, desire, arousal, orgasm, and 
self-image, and reduced distress in postmenopausal women.
• Associated with greater likelihood of reporting acne and hair growth
• No serious adverse events (breast, intermediate CV endpoints, 
uterus)
• Administration via non-oral routes (eg, transdermal application) 
preferred because of neutral lipid profile.

• Safety of 300 μg/day transdermal testosterone patch (TTP) 
treatment for up to 6 months in 1094 surgically menopausal women 
with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD)
• No important changes in the safety or tolerability profile of TTP were 
revealed with long-term use for up to 4 years in otherwise healthy 
oophorectomised women with HSDD on concomitant estrogen.
• No clinically significant changes in

Safety of Transdermal Testosterone over 
48months


## ページ 43

• Testosterone via transdermal route is moderately effective in the 
treatment of HSDD in peri and postmenopausal women 
• Compounded Testosterone , PELLETs, INJECTABLES and ORAL 
TESTOSTERONE IS NOT RECOMMENDED AND AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS 
• If you cannot get the government approved form , you must titrate 
the dose to 1/10 of government approved 1% transdermal male 
testosterone (300mcg/day) and monitor to premenopausal 
physiologic doses . Monitor total testosterone levels to ensure within 
premenopausal range
