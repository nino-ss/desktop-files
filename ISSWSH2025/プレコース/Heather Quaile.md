Learning Objectives 
• Define HSDD and Its Clinical Impact: Explain the clinical criteria for 
hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and its associated neurobiology, 
including the roles of key neurotransmitters and hormones.
• Describe and Compare FDA-Approved Treatments for HSDD: Evaluate the 
mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety profiles of Flibanserin and 
Bremelanotide for managing HSDD in premenopausal women.
• Assess Alternative and Investigational Treatment Options: Discuss the 
potential benefits and limitations of off-label agents, over-the-counter 
treatments, and emerging pharmacological approaches for HSDD.
• Apply Evidence-Based and Patient-Centered Decision-Making:Integrate
clinical trial data, patient preferences, and practical considerations, such as 
insurance coverage, into treatment recommendations for HSDD.

Definition of HSDD
1
Lack of motivation for 
sexual activity
Reduced or absent 
spontaneous or responsive 
desire, or inability to maintain 
desire
2
Loss of desire to 
initiate or participate
Including behavioral 
responses such as avoidance
3
Clinically significant personal distress
Includes frustration, grief, incompetence, loss, sorrow, or worry

Essential principles in POC
• Distinguish subtypes of HSDD, (e.g. generalized 
vs. situational and acquired vs. life-long)
• Identify associated modifiable factors
• Recognize importance of patient and partner
education during all phases of management
• Utilize goal-oriented focus with patient and partner
needs and preferences guiding recommendations
for treatment
• Provide clear guidance for follow-up and
consideration of referral

Melanocortins
• Melanocortins: peptide hormones
• Melanocortin receptors: 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled 
receptors
• stimulate the cAMP signal transduction pathway
• naturally occurring agonists and antagonists
• Extensive potential for targeted therapeutic activity
• HSDD, heart failure, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory diseases (IBS, 
nephritis, uveitis)
• pharmacologic challenges of drug delivery related to metabolic 
instability and subsequent rapid degradation of peptides

•Two FDA approved treatments exist to treat HSDD in 
premenopausal women
•Flibanserin is 100 mg taken nightly and can reduce distress 
associated with HSDD.
•Research supports its efficacy in postmenopausal women, but it 
is not FDA approved for that indication.
•Bremelanotide is self injected ‘as needed’ prior to sexual activity
•Additional agents with limited efficacy and safety data include 
bupropion and buspirone
•Additional OTC agents
