Principles of Physical Exam
• It’s never “required”
• Consent to start and throughout is imperative
• Do you really need a speculum?
• Build trust by offering the patient control
• Offer one part of exam at a time
• Offer for them to place speculum or ultrasound wand
• Self collection for cultures
• Offer pain management
• Topical anesthetics, exam under sedation
• Take breaks and cue diaphragmatic breathing. 
• We have a lot to learn from our pelvic floor physical therapy colleagues!

My preamble
• “We are going to perform a detailed exam of your vulva. 
• Here is a mirror so you can see exactly what we are touching and 
identify exactly where your pain is. 
• You are in complete control of this exam. If you need me to stop or 
pause at any time, please just say so and I will immediately stop. 
• We do not have to finish the exam today if you feel you need to come 
back to finish it another time.”
