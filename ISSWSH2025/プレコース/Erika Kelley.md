SCREENING


## ページ 15

SCREENING DURING VISIT

When? Any visit, when feels most 
natural. Also, re-screen over time 
(ask for permission: E.g., if patient 
says "no concerns", ask, "Is it OK if I 
check back with you about any 
potential sexual concerns in the 
future?").

How? using ubiquity statement, 
normalization, consider appropriate 
body language and privacy.

Ask/permission to discuss.
"Are you sexually 
active?"
"Are there sexual 
concerns you wish to 
discuss?"
yes
no
"I ask every patient I see about their sexual wellbeing. 
Many women experiencing [diabetes, cardiovascular 
problems, depression] have concerns about sexual 
functioning. What concerns do you have?"

medications, genital anatomy, educational 
resources and relevant patient information

evaluation of presenting problems (e.g., 
change position, use lubricants)

therapy, psychological interventions, 
and/or biomedical approaches)

## ページ 38

EDUCATION/ 
SEXUAL 
COUNSELING
Provide education (e.g., 
about sexual response, 
prevalence, contributing 
factors to low desire)
Evidence that supportive sex 
education improves desire
May be that it provides 
normalization and validation 
and increased self-
understanding 
May also be due to an 
increase in self-compassion
Perhaps also increased 
recognition of interoceptive 
awareness– teach patient to 
notice and attend to sexual 
arousal (Brotto et al., 2022 
JSR)


## ページ 39

SEX THERAPY
• Specialized form of psychotherapy that draws on an array of 
behavioral interventions known to effectively treat sexual 
dysfunction
• Sexual function is the focus 
• Offers insight and understanding to the genesis of the sexual problem
• Affectual awareness that strives for recognition of positive and negative 
emotions related to sexual interaction and desire
• Reframing cognitive factors and distracting thoughts
• Alters maladaptive behaviors
• Communication skills training
• Usually 5-20 sessions, includes between-session homework

Meston, 1997; Sawyer & Durllak

COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL MODEL
Cognitiv
e
Behavior
al
Physical
-
-Behavioral avoidance of sexual 
stimuli, communication, and 
activity
-leads to fewer positive sexual 
experiences
-negative self-image or –esteem
-negative beliefs about sex
-feeling incompetent
-attentional avoidance during sex (e.g., thinking of 
to-do list during sex)
-cognitive distraction draws attention away from 
erotic cues
-preoccupying ruminative thoughts
Low desire


## ページ 41

COMMON EXAMPLES OF MALADAPTIVE BELIEFS

“I’m not good enough for my partners”

“My partner will leave me”

“This will never be enjoyable”

“Something is wrong with me”

“My stomach looks so fat, I am unattractive”

"I'm not normal"

"I don't deserve to experience pleasure"

"My partner thinks I'm not attracted to them"

COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY
Cognitiv
e
Behavior
al
Physical
-Improve communication 
skills with partner
-Address interpersonal issues
-Reduce barriers to intimacy
-Reduce avoidance 
(e.g., avoiding looking at 
own body)
-Restructure maladaptive 
thoughts about self, sex, or 
sexual performance
-Redirect focus from 
performance to pleasure & 
sensuality
-Attentional re-direction
Improved desire

SENSATE FOCUS SEX THERAPY
Masters and Johnson, Human Sexual Inadequacy 1970
Weiner L & Avery-Clark C 2017. Sensate Focus in Sex
Therapy:The Illustrated Manual. New York, NY: 
Routledge
Developed by Masters and Johnson, late 1960’s
• a feared situation is gradually mastered by breaking it into discrete steps experienced under 
safe conditions and staying present with the experience
Sensate focus exercises combine elements of mindfulness and in-vivo 
desensitization 
• Decrease avoidance/anxiety
• Increase personal and interpersonal awareness of self and partner’s experiences/needs
• Improve sexual function
Series of progressive “sexual” exercises for individuals or couples with 3 
general goals:
Current use is less formulaic and more individualized


## ページ 44

SENSATE FOCUS SEX THERAPY
Appears exclusively behavioral
But, other psychosocial variables 
often are brought to light and can 
be addressed

E.g., these progressive partnered exercises 
may increase awareness of anxiety, 
communication difficulties, unhelpful or 
unrealistic beliefs about sex, relationship, or 
self etc.

MINDFULNESS

Can focus on targeting the relationship 
between awareness of sexual stimuli & 
responsive sexual desire

Growing research support for efficacy 
(Banbury et al., 2021; Brotto et al., 2021; 
Pyke & Clayton 2015)

Higher trait mindfulness --> decreased 
risk for FSD, sexual distress, & better 
sexual function (Sood et al., 2022)

Encourages increased attention to sexual 
cues

Encourages intentional awareness of bodily 
sensations

Non-judgment

Present-focused awareness

+Compassion (openness to one’s own 
suffering, alleviates suffering through 
kindness)

MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT)
Usually around 8-12 sessions (group or individual)
•neuroplastic changes in the structure and function of the brain regions involved in the regulation of 
attention, emotion and self awareness
Potential mechanisms: reduces depressive symptoms and self-criticism and 
increases mindfulness, interoceptive awareness, and self-compassion 
•Psychoeducation (e.g., sexual response, prevalence, contributing factors to low desire)
•Mindfulness practice (e.g., body awareness, body scan, mindfulness of thoughts and movement, 
non-masturbatory genital self-stimulation) (continued at home practice)
•Instructions for at-home practice of mindfulness after exposure to body touch or interactions with 
stimulus (e.g., vibrator, sexual content)
Sessions include:
