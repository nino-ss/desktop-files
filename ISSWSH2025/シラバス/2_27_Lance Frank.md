Function of the Pelvic Floor in Sexual Response
●Arousal - enhance blood flow to genital tissues, contributing to erections 
and cliteral engorgement/vagainal lubrication
●Penetration - relaxation allows vaginal expansion and reduces pain during 
penetration; coordinated muscle function supports erectile rigidity
●Orgasm - rhythmic contractions of the pelvic floor muscles intensify 
orgasm and enhance pleasure
●Ejaculation - PFM contractions assist semen propulsion and ejaculation 
control

Interventions

Assessment & Treatment Approaches
●External and / or internal pelvic floor muscle evaluations and 
examinations
○Assessing myofascial trigger points, ROM, strength, flexibility, 
coordination, overall mobility
●Manual Therapy
●Neuromuscular Re-Education
●Therapeutic Exercise
●Biofeedback
(Stein et al., 2019)


## ページ 14

Pain Reduction Strategies
●Myofascial + connective tissue release techniques
●Neuromuscular downtraining
●Relaxation + breathing techniques
●Modalities
○Dry needling, shockwave therapy, biofeedback
●Mobility and/or strengthening exercises
(Stein et al., 2019)


## ページ 15

Enhancing Sexual Function
●
Core + pelvic floor strengthening
○
Improves blood flow and can enhance orgasm intensity and sensation 
(Jorge et al., 2024).
●
Coordination training
○
Can improve neuromuscular control and help prevent involuntary 
contractions / spasms (Rosenbaum, 2007).
●
Breathwork & Relaxation
○
Reduces PFM tension and improves parasympathetic response for better 
arousal (Jorge et al., 2024).


## ページ 16

Communication & Partner Involvement
●Exercises for couples to improve intimacy, connection, 
and trust
○Often refer to couples therapists or sex therapists
●Include partners in pelvic therapy sessions and HEP
