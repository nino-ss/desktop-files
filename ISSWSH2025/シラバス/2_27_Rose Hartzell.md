TREATING A SEXUAL 
ISSUES DISRUPTS THE 
CURRENT COUPLE 
SYSTEM  
(NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUAL YOU ARE TREATING) 


## ページ 7

Let me start with a story…


## ページ 8

Intersystem Approach
Individual-biological/medical
Individual-psychological
Dyadic relationship or couple dynamics
Intergenerational influences (patterns, 
values, attachment style, etc)
Contextual factors such as 
society/culture/history/religion/physical 
environment

Psychosocial dyadic dynamics are  
one piece of the puzzle

## ページ 10

Dyadic Issues Impact on Multiple 
Levels
Predisposing factors 
◦can make an individual more vulnerable to sexual 
dysfunctions
Precipitating factors 
◦those that trigger a sexual condition
Maintaining factors
◦prolong and exacerbate a sexual dysfunction
Althof, S.,  Leiblum., Ghevret-Measson, M., Hartmann, U., Levine, S., McCabe, M., Plaut, M., Rodrigues, O., & Wylie, K. 
(2005). Psychological and interpersonal dimensions of sexual function and dysfunction. Journal of Sexual Medicine, 2, 793-
800.

DYSFUNCTION MAY 
SERVE SERVE A 
FUNCTION IN THE 
RELATIONSHIP
(E.G. PARTNER MAY HAVE PAIN OR ILLNESS)


## ページ 12

There is a lot to cover, 
so I’m 
just going to do 
an overview


## ページ 13

Erectile Difficulties and the Couple
Treating ED can increase FSFI (Goldstein, et al.,, 2005)
Partners response to ED (are they 
contributing) 
◦Supportive vs anxiety provoking
Treatment can also impact dynamics
◦eg implant and GSM


## ページ 14

Orgasm and the Couple
Some women (and men) are unable to 
communicate their specific desires 
regarding physical stimulation, intensity, 
and focus of stimulation (Kelly, et al., 2006: Witting, et al., 2008)
Partner variables, such as lack of 
experience, knowledge about sexual 
stimulation, or indifference to partners 
arousal can contribute to orgasm 
difficulties


## ページ 15

Genito-Pelvic Pain and the Couple
Partner perception of, and reactions to 
genito-pelvic pain are repeatedly 
associated with pain intensity in women, 
as well as well-being and sexual function 
in both partners (Pukall et al., 2016; Rosen & Bergeron, 2018)
Depend on if the partner is highly 
solicitous, negative, or facilitative


## ページ 16

Solicitous partners
Halt all sexual activity at the first hint of a 
woman’s discomfort
Reinforce avoidance 
Prevent experimentation that 
◦discomfort may be tolerable or 
◦able to be overpowered by increasing arousal


## ページ 17

Negative Partners (hostile, angry)
Can contribute to 
◦increased pain
◦decrements in sexual function
◦diminished sexual and relationship satisfaction 
(Bergeron, Corsini-Munt, Aerts, Rancourt & Rosen, 2015)


## ページ 18

Facilitative partners
Characterized by encouraging the woman 
and positively reinforcing her attempts to 
have sex are associated w/ lower pain 
reports and greater well-being and sexual 
function in both the woman and her 
partner (Rosen, Bergeron, Sadikaj, & Delisle, 2015)


## ページ 19

Desire and the Couple
What is ‘low’ desire or OCSB?
Is it desire discrepancy?
Adherence to a rigid sexual scripts (Sanchez, 2005)
◦Sexual monotony (Cavalho & Nabre, 2011)
Male HSDD can be secondary to sexual 
dysfunction in his partner (e.g. knowing 
their partner is not interested in sex) (Murray, 
Milhausen, Graham & Kuczynski, 2017)

the sexual experience as well as variable initial (spontaneous) desire.

## ページ 21

Desire and the Couple
Two motivations for having sex
◦Approaching a positive goal (relationship 
satisfaction, physical pleasure)
◦Avoiding a negative outcome (partner 
disappointment or relational conflict) (Muise, 
Bourdreau, & Rosen, 2017)
Relational dynamics and other contextual 
factors strongly influence sexual desire in 
women (Mark, Herbenick, Fortenberry, Sanders, & Reece, 2014)
