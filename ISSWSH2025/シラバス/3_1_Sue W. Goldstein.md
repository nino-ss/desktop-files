in status

lifestyle changed: men went from hunting/  
gathering to agriculture/settlement

Sex in Antiquity
In ancient Greece men ruled, women were subordinate, had no rights
▪Women were married ages 12 - 14  
▪Only allowed sex with their husbands, expected to do so at least three 
times a month
Women considered irrational, over-sexed, morally defective: lonely lives
Men could have sex outside of marriage with prostitutes or other men
Greek women waited for husbands to want sex, or masturbated
 
Led to use of dildo

Sex in the East
Taoism (500 BC) advised as much sex as possible for men: more 
female partners for intercourse, greater benefit derived 
Intercourse: interaction between woman’s vaginal moisture (yin) and 
ejaculate (yang)
Loss of semen concerning; cunnilingus/female masturbation 
approved because they stimulated yin

Pleasure
Greek philosopher Aristotle (348-322 BC) wrote: 
“The pleasure that comes with coitus” is due to the 
fact that not only seed is emitted, but also air' 
Sexual pleasure is not only for men: 'Some 
people think' that a woman produces semen 
during coitus, because sometimes she 
experiences just as much pleasure as a man and 
at the same time secretes moisture.' Between her 
pleasure and a pregnancy there is no connection: 
it happens that a woman does not become 
pregnant 'even if her pleasure is not less' than that 
of a man and man and woman with equal pace.”

Christianity – Sex a Sin
Sex voluntary: limited to relationship between man & woman in marriage
Women had to be obedient and submissive 
Augustine wrote “sexual appetite is a true sin and a serious hindrance to a        
virtuous life”
An erection was sinful, but erections could occur spontaneously so women  
had to behave in a way that men would not be sexually aroused
Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) wrote in 1265: “any form of sex not intended for procreation 
is sinful and a crime against nature also within marriage.”

Neurasthenia
In 1869 The Science of a New Life claimed girls who masturbated would grow 
small breasts, a sign of unhealthy development—the only natural sexual behavior 
was heterosexual coitus in marriage
American neurologist Beard introduced neuarasthenia caused by 
unnatural sex (any sexual practice not for reproduction). Symptoms: 
• fatigue after physical or mental exertion
• concentration problems
• muscle cramps 
• Inability to relax

Masturbation Treatment
In 19th century circumcision could prevent masturbation; treat alcoholism, syphilis, 
epilepsy, inguinal hernia, and asthma 
Vasectomy could “cure” masturbation
Women must be chaste; men's sexual excesses tolerated if performed in secret 
Too much sexual activity could lead to loss of involuntary semen and therefore 
impotence

Sexual Pleasure
British gynecologist Action claimed “The majority of women, luckily for them, 
do not suffer much from sexual feelings of any kind. So they can easily do 
without sex”
Women felt pain or nothing at all during coitus, definitely not pleasure 
For people older than 50, sexual pleasure considered too exhausting, cause of 
paralysis

Freud’s Theories
Purpose of sex was heterosexual coitus, although homosexuality not a disease
Orgasm provided temporary relief of sexual tension, stopped sexual drive for a 
period of time, at least for men
In contrast, feminine lust was forbidden, perpetuated by the myth: 
• men always want to have sex 
• women interested in sex considered “sluts”/not normal
Vaginal orgasm seen as “the way it should be”- if a woman could not orgasm 
through penetration there was something wrong with her 
Freud also believed that women had penis envy
