ISSWSH ORGASM CONSENSUS PANEL
The ISSWSH Executive Committee selected co-chairs to organize a panel to develop 
consensus regarding Female Orgasm Disorder (FOD) including: 
• nomenclature of orgasm
• physiology of orgasm 
• epidemiology and pathophysiology of FOD
• classification and evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of FOD 
The co-chairs identified international multidisciplinary experts in:
• clinical psychology
• sex therapy
• basic science
• neurophysiology
• gynecology
• urology
• psychiatry
• physiology
• pharmacology
• endocrinology
• reproductive endocrinology
• sexual medicine
• sexuality education
• pelvic floor physical therapy

## ページ 8

A variable, transient, peak sensation of intense pleasure, creating an 
altered state of consciousness, usually with an initiation accompanied 
by involuntary rhythmic contractions of the pelvic striated 
circumvaginal musculature, often with concomitant uterine and anal 
contractions, and myotonia that resolves the sexually induced 
vasocongestion and myotonia, generally with an induction of well-
being and contentment.

## ページ 10

The 2025 ISSWSH consensus panel on orgasm in women addressed limitations of 
previous definitions by incorporating into a new proposed definition the: 
I.
repetitive genital and/or non-genital sensory stimulation that elicits the 
progressive positive feedback "climb" of excitation
II.
myotonia that involves more than the pelvic floor including multiple 
somatic/visceral body regions
III. intense pleasure of orgasm that involves sensory awareness of both genital/non-
genital stimulation and proprioceptive response to the whole-body myotonia and 
the subsequent cessation of the stimulation with de-activation and resolution of 
excitation
IV. identification of three phases of orgasm that allows for categorization of orgasm 
disorders
New definition should be more clinically relevant for patient management.
PROPOSED 2025 ISSWSH DEFINITION OF ORGASM:
 NOT YET CONSENSED 


## ページ 11

Orgasm is a feeling of intense pleasure that 
•
(pre-orgasm phase) is generated by repetitive genital and/or non-genital 
stimulation increasing physiologic arousal and whole body myotonia resulting in 
awareness and appreciation of a progressive positive feedback increase “climb” 
in excitation
•
(orgasm phase) reaches a peak of positive feedback excitation surpassing the 
orgasm threshold, followed by release and relaxation of whole-body myotonia, 
cessation of the stimulation and de-activation/resolution of the excitation that is 
perceived as intensely pleasurable ending with satiety and/or contentment or 
continuation/re-activation of the stimulation leading to further orgasm(s)
•
(post-orgasm phase) and return to the baseline pre-orgasm state
Orgasm may be accompanied by concomitant ejaculation

Pre-orgasm phase:
Involves repetitive stimulation of:
▪genital somatic (clitoris, vulva) region and/or
▪genital visceral (vagina, vestibule, prostate) region and/or
▪non-genital (nipple, toes, ear) regions 
resulting in a "climb" of excitation
Includes awareness and appreciation of a progressive positive feedback 
increase (climb) in excitation involving:
• whole-body myotonia
• respiratory and heart rate
• genital and/or non-genital tissue glandular secretion/lubrication (vestibule, 
vagina, cervix, Bartholin mucus, epinephrine, tears, salivation) 
• engorgement / vasocongestion (clitoris, vulva, face, chest)
• pupil dilation, nipple engorgement

Orgasm phase:
Involves: 
•
peak of positive feedback excitation surpassing the orgasm threshold
•
release and relaxation of whole-body myotonia

pleasurable, ending with satiety and/or contentment
