• The FDA cautions that prescribing T 
products is approved only for men who 
have low T levels caused by specific 
medical conditions
• Only subjects with primary or secondary 
HG resulting from problems within the 
testis, pituitary, or hypothalamus (e.g. 
genetic problems, or damage from 
surgery, chemotherapy, or infection) 
should be treated.

Specific Medical Conditions Associated with 
Secondary Hypogonadism
Of the 89% of men without a known 
cause of TD, 71% will have one of 3 
conditions: diabetes; obesity or 
metabolic syndrome
Thus, the majority of patients we treat for 
TD are “off-label”

T Def: A barometer of overall poor health:  
 
?Reversible with lifestyle changes
• The diagnosis of functional (age-related) 
hypogonadism should prompt thorough assessment & 
optimization of general health including:
Lifestyle changes
• Weight reduction
• Enhanced care of comorbidities
• T Treatment improves libido, may be less effective for 
erectile dysfunction (ED)
• TTh may have modest positive effects on insulin 
resistance, bone strength, some measures of physical 
strength and mild depressive symptoms

## ページ 10

Understanding the History 
Testosterone Th
• In late 1980s, rarely used and almost not at all in 
urology
• Reserved for men with unequivocal or severe 
testosterone deficiencies
– Absent testes
– Pituitary/hypothalamic tumors or resection
– Genetic abnormalities, eg, Klinefelter syndrome
• Not recognized as useful in otherwise healthy men with 
sexual or other symptoms
• Until the FDA approval of topical gel: Androgel 1% in 
2001 broadened its use.

TRAVERSE is a response to the FDA directive in 
2015
•
“We are also requiring manufacturers of 
approved testosterone products to conduct a 
well-designed clinical trial to more clearly 
address the question
of whether an increased risk of heart attack or 
stroke exists among users of these products”

hypogonadal men with existing CV disease or risk factors was 
recently reported June 2023
⚫Based on results of a prospective, placebo-controlled trial of 
testosterone gel versus placebo in 5,246 men aged 45-80 years, 
testosterone is not associated with increased overall cardiovascular 
risk, despite, a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism (0.9% vs 
0.5%), acute kidney injury (2.3% vs 1.5%), and atrial fibrillation         
(3.5% vs 2.4%) in the testosterone group.

Limitations of TRAVERSE:
⚫Adherence and retention in this trial was lower than in 
most cardiovascular outcomes, but similar to other 
trials in symptomatic condition
⚫“Cardiovascular safety findings are limited to that 
population, not to men who do not have indications 
for testosterone therapy but who nevertheless may 
receive it through “low T centers” or other 
unscrupulous prescribers.” 
⚫“This study should not be used as a justification for the 
widespread prescription of testosterone to aging men”
---Steven Nissen, MD, Chief Academic Officer of 
Cleveland Clinic’s Heart, Vascular & Thoracic Institute 


## ページ 33

Conclusion
⚫TRAVERSE is the largest randomized placebo-
controlled trial in hypogonadal men to date
⚫Among middle-aged or older men with 
hypogonadism, who had a history of established CV 
disease or who were at high risk for incident CV 
events, TRT for a mean duration of 22 months did not 
increase the risk of major CV events

⚫1161 hypogonadal men with low libido enrolled in the Sexual Function 
Study 
– 587 1.62% testosterone gel
– 574  placebo gel 
⚫Primary outcome: change from baseline in sexual activity (PDQ-4)
⚫Secondary outcomes: hypogonadal symptoms, EF, and sexual desire (HIS-
Q, IIEF-EF, Patient Global Impression of Improvement in Libido question)
Results: 
⚫TTh associated with significantly greater improvement in sexual activity 
than placebo
⚫TTh improved hypogonadal symptoms and sexual desire, but not erectile 
function, compared with placebo
⚫Treatment effect was maintained at 24 months

⚫Objective: To determine whether 
testosterone treatment would reduce the 
risk of clinical fractures in hypogonadal men
⚫5204 participants (2601 in TTh group and 
2603 in placebo group)
⚫Median follow-up of 3.19 years
⚫Clinical fracture occurred in 91 participants 
(3.50%) in the testosterone group and 64 
participants (2.46%) in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.97)
Reasons:  
1. Increased activity due to being on testosterone
2. Fractures seemed to occur early on before T could have 
had any benefit
3. Only a modest increase in T and E, 148, which may not 
have been enough

– All randomly assigned men
– All men with significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 Score >4)
– Men with rigorously defined, late on-set, low-grade persistent 
depressive disorder [LG-PDD] previously “dysthymia”
⚫Outcomes:
– Men meeting criteria for LG-PDD or significant depressive 
symptoms
– Changes in depressive symptoms, energy, sleep quality, and 
cognition in using the Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms 
Questionnaire (HIS-Q) at baseline and at months 6, 12, and 24

– 2643 (50.8%) had significant

not cognition or sleep 
quality
– 1.5% men met rigorous 
criteria for LG-PDD
• No significant difference

Conclusions
•
Low testosterone is associated with increased CV risk
•
Current data support a low CV risk in men on TTh and 
improvements in cardiometabolic parameters
•
Normalization of T levels may reduce risk of death, MI and 
stroke
•
There are no data currently supporting an increased risk of 
prostate cancer or prostate cancer recurrence / progression 
in men on TTh
