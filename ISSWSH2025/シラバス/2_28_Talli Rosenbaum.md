PTSD and Sex: What we already know
• PTSD disrupts emotional regulation 
and attachment, key elements for 
intimacy.
• Sexual arousal mimics the stress 
response (HPA axis involvement).
• Challenges: Hypervigilance, 
emotional distance, and sexual 
dysfunction.
• PTSD is an independent risk factor for 
sexual dysfunction

Experiencing two separate worlds
• Soldiers:
• Disconnection between battlefield hypermasculinity and 
intimacy at home.
• "I feel nothing" syndrome: Emotional numbness and 
withdrawal.
• Sexual dysfunction due to exhaustion and hyporarousal
• Fear of hyperarousal
• Struggles with vulnerability
• Partners:
• Caregiving burdens and miscommunication.
• Emotional distance due to differing coping mechanisms.
• He is strange, different and “other”
• Overfunctionality :“don’t come back”
13
Implications for Therapy
• Therapeutic Recommendations:
• Normalize the impact of acute and chronic stress and the 
war on intimacy and sexuality
• Encourage couples to communicate openly about their 
experiences.
• Incorporate trauma-informed care and somatic 
therapies.

"Recovery can take place only within the 
context of relationships; it cannot occur in 
isolation.
"Sharing the traumatic experience with 
others is a precondition for the restitution of 
a meaningful world.”
