Cannabis extracts used for millenia
Medical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt over 4000 years ago describe extracts of cannabis
used for sexual, gynecological, and reproductive purposes.
c. 1890
Like the PDE-5 inhibitors, e.g., sildenafil (Viagra®),
local application of THC to the genitals stimulates
nitric oxide.  This relaxes smooth muscle and 
blood vessels, allowing blood into the corpora
and stimulating erection of the clitoris and penis.
Local application 
does not usually get
into the blood stream.

Level 2-5 evidence (females):
Women (level 4-5):
Female rats (level 2):
● LOW doses of THC increase lordosis, solicitations, and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)
   indicative of orgasm-like responses (OLRs) in OVX rats primed with a low dose of 
   estradiol with or without progesterone.
● AEA increases sexual motivation in a runway test. 
● The inverse agonist rimonabant also increases lordosis, solicitations, and motivation.
● High doses of THC inhibit solicitations and lordosis.
● CB1Rs in the midbrain are downregulated during estrus.
Lynn, Gee, Zhang, Pfaus, (2020) Sex Med Rev, 8, 18-21.
● Acute, “low doses” of cannabis increase sexual arousal and desire and the quality
    of orgasm in women.  
● High dosing to the point of sedative effects on motor function and increased anxiety
    inhibits sexual responding. 
● Direct dose-response studies and RCTs of THC or other cannabinoids have not been 
    conducted in humans, although topical gels that contain THC and CBD are in the pipeline.
● Peripheral THC can increase in vaginal/clitoral blood flow.


## ページ 33

Level 2-5 evidence (males):
Men (level 4-5):
Male rats (level 2):
● Acute or subchronic administration of CB1 agonists impairs both intromissions and 
   ejaculations. 
● Acute administration of CB1 antagonists induce erections, reduce the number of 
    intromissions necessary for ejaculation, and reduce ejaculation latencies. 
● The inverse agonist rimonabant also increases mounts and intromissions in sexually
    sluggish males. 
● High doses of THC inhibit gonadotrophin stimulation of testosterone synthesis.
● BUT…  AEA applied to the penis stimulates erection! (CB1Rs in corpus cavernosum).
Gorzalka, Hill, Chang, (2010) Horm Behav, 58, 91-99.
● Acute, “low doses” of cannabis increase sexual arousal, desire, the quality of orgasm
    in men, and increase the duration of intercourse.  
● High dosing to the point of sedative effects on motor function and increased anxiety
    inhibits. 
● Chronic dosing sensitizes desire but decreases erectile function (like alcohol). Notably,
    high chronic dosing decreases gonadotrphin stimulation of testosterone synthesis.
● Direct dose-response studies and RCTs of THC or other cannabinoids have not been 
    conducted in human males.

Take Home Messages:
1. Low doses of cannabinoids (especially THC) appear to facilitate sexual arousal, desire, and orgasm in females and 
 
males. However, higher doses induce sedation and ataxia, and/or augment anxiety.  Although CBD does not
 
appear to induce any of these effects, it can relax pelvic floor muscles and reduce pelvic pain locally.
2. Cannabinoids facilitate through a decrease in serotonin-induced inhibition and/or an increase in excitatory
 
dopamine transmission.
3. Psychedelics act as direct or indirect agonists for 5-HT1a and 5-HT2a receptors. Some, like LSD, mescaline, and DMT, 
       
also act as agonists at D2 and α2 receptors. ß-carbolines (e.g., harmine) act as MAO inhibitors.
4. On their own, hallucinogenic doses of psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, and LSD inhibit sexual responses. However, 
 
microdosing appears to equilibrate serotonergic and dopaminergic functions. MDMA may stimulate
 
sexual arousal and desire by its actions as a DAT inhibitor, but can also delay or prevent orgasm by its actions
 
as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SERT).
5.   Long-term microdosing of psychedelics appears to increase attention, sensitivity, and “mindfulness” toward
 
sexual stimuli, and reduce depression and anxiety. A 6-month follow up of people who microdosed
 
psilocybin reported fewer sexual dysfunctions and an overall enhancement of sexual functioning, in
 
addition to increased quality of life overall.  Greater efficacy than escitalopram.
