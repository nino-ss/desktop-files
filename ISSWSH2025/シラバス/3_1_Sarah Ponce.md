addressing systemic barriers and fostering equity within the field.
Illustrate the role of community health programs in fostering inclusive dialogues around sexual
health, addressing the impacts of stigma, delayed diagnoses, and medical gaslighting on patient
outcomes.
Integrate female sexual function into medical training across specialties and subspecialties,
dismantling gender-based stereotypes and expanding the perceived scope of practice for sexual
medicine.
