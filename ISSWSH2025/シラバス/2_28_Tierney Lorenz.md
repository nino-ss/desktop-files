Four themes, all emphasizing need for 
cultural humility in sexual healthcare
• Sexual pleasure and satisfaction
• Lower sexual experience and knowledge in migrant women, leading to lower 
reported pleasure
• Highly heterogeneous findings
• Sexual desire and arousal
• Greater desire/arousal problems in migrant women, but not necessarily greater 
distress
• Sexual attitudes
• Perceived lower control over sexuality in migrant women 
• Greater sexual guilt if cultural sexual standards not met
• Acculturation
• Lower mainstream acculturation may contribute to higher anxiety around 
sexuality

Clinical recommendations
• Directly assess sexual knowledge 
• Ask about history of sexual healthcare experiences
• Ask for permission to offer education and 
information on sexuality
• Normalize having questions about one’s sexuality
• Normalize talking to medical provider about sexuality
• Reassure patients with high sex guilt & anxiety
• Especially as they adjust to a new culture with different 
sexual ideals
• Promote pleasure as a positive & appropriate goal
• Use culturally sensitive assessment tools
• And help us researchers develop more!
