have made a difference?”

Intimacy -Physical Or Emotional
Do you know the difference and why it matters?
We may not all think of intimacy the same
way, though we all want to feel an attachment 
or closeness to others. Physical intimacy is
commonly referred to as sexual intimacy, while
emotional intimacy is described to be something 
totally different... but is it?
Emotional intimacy is all about our emotional 
connection and attachment with others. It is a
special connection at a deep level but requires
no physical contact. Emotional intimacy can be 
enhanced by physical touch, but it can also be 
the motivator for sexual desire.
Common Problems
• Changes in energy level, body image,
confidence, and relationship roles may be
experienced by anyone who has been impacted 
by cancer.
• Problems may be specific to penetrative sex,
erection, ejaculation, vaginal dryness, inability 
to orgasm, or pain during sex. Other concerns 
are related to feeling less attractive, a loss of 
desire, or periods of extreme fatigue.
• Some problems resolve after treatment, while 
others may be persistent and long lasting.
• Relationships are often affected by cancer
treatment, causing partners to have their own 
need for information and support.
Sexual Scripts
Cancer treatment can influence how we think
and feel about ourselves as sexual beings. Your
sexual script is the way you and your partner
express intimacy and affection to one another.
Your script is what you do to transition from a
non-sexual interaction to a sexual one.
It may be difficult to follow the same script after 
treatment. Your desire may be different, and
physical changes impact your ability to have sex 
the same way as before.
Communicating with a partner about these
changes is a first step to figuring out how to 
rewrite your sexual script and be comfortable 
and confident about intimacy again.
Questions for Your Doctor
• How will my cancer therapy affect my sex life?
• Is it safe for me and my partner to have sex 
during my treatment?
• What can I do before, during, or after my
treatment to lessen the negative on my sexual 
functioning?
• What can my partner expect from the sexual 
health side effects?
• What changes should I be watching for?
• What resources are available to address the 
changes my intimate relationships?
• What have other patients,undergoing the same 
treatment found helpful for sexual side effects?
About After Cancer
Our goal is to empower patients and provide
educational resources for patient care teams on
addressing sexual side effects from diagnosis
through survivorship. We provide solutions for
sexual health so you have the information you
need to be in charge.
