Abstract
Introduction: Striae distensae (SD), or stretch marks, result from rapid stretching of 
the skin due to various factors. Conventional treatments often yield unsatisfactory 
results, leading to the exploration of alternative methods. Laser-­induced microjet 
technology offers a promising approach for drug delivery to target areas. This study 
investigates the efficacy of using a microjet injector with poly-­d,l-­lactic acid for treat-
ing SD.
Methods: Four female participants with SD were treated with poly-­d,l-­lactic acid so-
lution using a microjet injector over five sessions. Patients were assessed based on 
severity scales before and after treatment. Topical anesthetics were applied to mini-
mize discomfort. Injection techniques were optimized to reduce side effects such as 
bleeding and pain.
Results: All patients showed significant improvement in SD appearance after 5–7 
treatments. Assessment scales indicated positive outcomes both immediately after 
treatment and at the 32-­week follow-­up. Minimal side effects, primarily petechiae, 
were observed.
Discussion: Laser-­induced microjet technology offers several advantages, including 
rapid drug delivery and mechanotransduction effects, promoting skin regeneration. 
Poly-­d,l-­lactic acid injections demonstrated effectiveness in treating SD, particularly 
when delivered via microjet injectors. Patients expressed high satisfaction due to the 
procedure's minimal invasiveness and quick recovery.
Conclusion: Utilizing a needleless microjet injector with poly-­d,l-­lactic acid shows 
promise as a treatment for SD, typically requiring 5–7 sessions for optimal results. 
Mild petechiae may occur as a common side effect. This approach offers an effective 
and minimally invasive alternative for addressing this common cosmetic concern.

1  |  INTRODUCTION
Striae distensae (SD), a form of skin scarring that occurs when 
the skin stretches rapidly, can result from various causes such 
as pregnancy, rapid weight gain, growth spurts, certain med-
ical conditions, or prolonged use of potent topical steroids.1 
Histologically, the epidermis becomes thinner, and there is pro-
nounced damage to the fibrous tissue of the dermis.2 Particularly, 
severe damage to elastic fibers occurs along with collagen fibers. 
There is minimal regeneration of elastic fibers, posing consider-
able challenges for existing treatments aimed at regenerating 
these fibers and patients seek treatment for cosmetic reasons. 
Methods explored in the literature for improving SD are included 
in Table 1.
Drug delivery through the skin is a significant concern in derma-
tological procedures.3,4 Recently, advancements in technology have 
led to the development of laser induced microjet device that utilize 
laser energy to deliver a sufficient amount of medication to the de-
sired depth of the skin rapidly and evenly without causing significant 
damage.5–7 This technology operates with high-­speed jet pressure, 
generating strong vibrations and shocks within the dermis at a fre-
quency of 30–40 Hz, which can provide physical signals of mecha-
notransduction to the cells.7 Repetitive tapping and micro-­tearing 
can serve as important signals for skin regeneration. Among various 
needleless injection devices developed recently, laser induced mi-
crojet device stands out for its ability to achieve the highest speed 
of 40 Hz.
This study has utilized laser-­induced micro-­jet injectors with poly-­
d,l-­lactic acid (PDLLA) as an approach for treating patients with SD.
2  |  METHODS
Four female participants with SD were included in this investiga-
tion. The treatment involved the precise administration of PDLLA 
(Juvelook, VAIM Global, South Korea) solution using the microjet 
injection system (Mirajet, JSK Inc., South Korea), conducted either 
once or twice monthly for a total of five sessions. Minimal post-­
procedural side effects were observed, mainly transient bleeding.
This retrospective case series included women aged 32, 37, 53, 
and 28, enrolled between February 2023 and June 2023. These 
adult patients sought treatment for SD on their buttocks, thighs, 
and abdomen, all classified as Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV. Inclusion 
criteria required mild-­to-­moderate visibility of SD, while exclusion 
criteria encompassed recent procedures such as energy-­based de-
vices within the past 6 months. They were measured in the Striae 
Distensae Severity Scale (SDSS) with categories of mild, moderate, 
severe, and extremely severe.8
To alleviate discomfort, a topical anesthetic cream contain-
ing lidocaine and prilocaine was applied to the treatment area 
30 min prior to the procedure. For SD treatment, a mixture of 
lidocaine and epinephrine was added to the drug to minimize 
bleeding and pain, administered at low energy levels before the 
main treatment. The procedure involved overlapping injections 
Method
Description
Topical treatments
Creams containing tretinoin (a retinoid) can restore collagen and 
make stretch marks less noticeable, though tretinoin should not 
be used during pregnancy. Topical hyaluronic acid can increase 
skin elasticity and reduce the visibility of stretch marks. Applying 
moisturizers to affected areas regularly can make stretch marks 
less noticeable
Microdermabrasion
A procedure to remove dead skin cells, improving the appearance and 
texture of the skin
Microneedling 
radiofrequency
Stimulates collagen production by creating tiny holes in the skin's 
surface and using heat energy from radiofrequency to help 
improve the appearance of stretch marks
Laser therapy
Effective for both red and white stretch marks. Pulsed dye laser 
therapy can be effective for early red striae. Fractional non-­
ablative laser can aid in the regeneration of older white striae
Ultrasound
High-­intensity focused ultrasound can stimulate collagen production 
to improve the appearance of stretch marks
Platelet-­rich plasma 
(PRP)
Used in conjunction with microneedling, PRP involves injecting a 
small amount of the patient's blood processed and injected into 
stretch marks
Chemical peels
Application of chemical substances to the skin can promote 
exfoliation, improving the appearance of stretch marks
Poly-­D,L-­lactic acid 
(PDLLA)
Recently introduced and used in South Korea, these treatments show 
promising results in quickly regenerating not only challenging 
stretch marks but also wider areas affected by them

rather than dropping the nozzle, which proved advantageous in 
reducing pain and facilitating micro-­incision (Video S1). In cases 
of injecting strong energy with rounded particles such as PDLLA, 
minor bleeding was observed, necessitating immediate pressure 
treatment as the procedure progressed through the treatment 
area. Effective pressure treatment post-­procedure can reduce 
the duration of residual bruising. During the procedure, minor 
bleeding was managed by wiping the area with gauze soaked in 
a 10% dilution of hydrogen peroxide and epinephrine, aiding in 
hemostasis and visibility.
Patient improvement was assessed before the procedure and 
at 32 weeks using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) 
by two physicians, who assigned scores ranging from −1 to 3. 
Patient satisfaction with aesthetic outcomes was self-­evaluated 
on a scale of 0 to 3 at the conclusion of the procedure and again 
at 32 weeks, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction 
levels.
3  |  RESULTS
All assessments from both the GAIS and the patient satisfaction 
scale indicated positive results during the 32-­week follow-­up. See 
Table 2 for a summary of all results.
3.1  |  Case 1
A 32-­year-­old woman underwent the buttock SD treatment, re-
ceiving a total of five treatments. She reported an 8-­year history 
of stretch marks, which developed during rapid weight gain in her 
mid-­20s. Initially, both physicians assigned a score of severe on the 
SDSS. After 32 weeks, improvements were noted, with the sever-
ity grading reducing to mild. The GAIS scores from both physicians 
indicated significant improvement (score 2) compared to the initial 
assessment. The patient herself expressed satisfaction, rating her 
outcome as 1 on a 4-­point questionnaire. Side effects included pe-
techia lasting for 4 days.
3.2  |  Case 2
A 37-­year-­old woman underwent abdominal SD treatment, under-
going a total of seven treatments. She had a history of abdomi-
nal stretch marks for 2 years following the birth of her first child. 
Initially, both physicians assigned a score of extremely severe on 
the SDSS. After 32 weeks improvements were observed, with 
the severity grading decreasing to moderate (Figure 1). The GAIS 
scores from both physicians indicated significant improvement 
(score 2) compared to the initial assessment. The patient herself 
expressed satisfaction, rating her outcome as 1 on a 4-­point ques-
tionnaire. Side effects include bumpiness of 4 days and petechiae 
lasting for 9 days.
3.3  |  Case 3
A 53-­year-­old woman underwent the thigh SD treatment, receiving 
a total of six treatments. She reported having thigh stretch marks for 
around 10 years due to rapid weight gain. Initially, both physicians 
assessed her condition as severe on the SDSS scale. After 32 weeks, 
improvements were noted, with the severity grading reducing to 
mild and moderate. The GAIS scores from both physicians indicated 
significant improvement (score 1) compared to the initial assess-
ment. The patient herself expressed satisfaction, rating her outcome 
as 2 on a 4-­point questionnaire. Side effects included petechiae last-
ing for 4 days.
3.4  |  Case 4
A 28-­year-­old woman underwent the buttock SD treatment, under-
going a total of five treatments. She reported having buttock stretch 
marks since her early 20s due to rapid weight gain. Initially, both 
physicians assessed her condition as extremely severe on the SDSS 
scale. After 32 weeks, improvements were observed, with the se-
verity grading decreasing to severe and moderate. The GAIS scores 
from both physicians indicated significant improvement (score 2) 
TA B LE 2 An overview of the assessment scores used in the study. The Striae Distensae Severity Scale (SDSS) scores, ranging from mild 
to extremely severe, were determined independently by two physicians before and 32 weeks after treatment. These scores indicate the 
severity of the striae distensae present on the patients' bodies. Additionally, the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) scores were 
evaluated by both physicians after 32 weeks of treatment, reflecting the overall improvement in aesthetic appearance. Furthermore, patient 
satisfaction scores, obtained through self-­reporting using a 4-­point questionnaire, indicate the level of satisfaction with the treatment 
outcome.

compared to the initial assessment. The patient herself expressed 
satisfaction, rating her outcome as 2 on a 4-­point questionnaire. Side 
effects included petechiae lasting for 1 week.
All patients in this study had significant improvement in the ap-
pearance of their SD after a total of 5–7 treatments. Patient satis-
faction of the procedure was also extremely high, due to the short 
nature of the treatment, quick recovery time and preclusion of nee-
dles or anesthesia.
4  |  DISCUSSION
Patients have a strong preference for choosing non-­invasive aes-
thetic procedures. The popularity of energy-­based devices in 
recent years has been met with caution due to potential side ef-
fects that can occur such as erythema, blistering, infection and 
pigmentary changes.9 SD is a common skin condition that affects 
males and females, often appearing in areas such as the abdo-
men, breasts, thighs and buttocks, causing significant cosmetic 
concerns. Despite the array of treatment modalities available, 
including topical medications, energy-­based devices, and surgical 
procedures, satisfactory results in treating this prevalent condi-
tion remain elusive. Here, we present the success of a laser-­based, 
needleless microjet transdermal drug delivery system for the 
treating condition.7
Using lasers as a power source, the fundamental principle of cre-
ating a strong output is by concentrating energy on a medium that 
absorbs the laser and inducing the medium's rupture to generate 
micro-­jets. Selecting the appropriate laser wavelength, pulse width, 
effective medium for laser absorption, and robust sealed chamber 
are necessary. A special liquid medium that absorbs the laser and a 
sub-­chamber for storing the drug are separated by an elastic mem-
brane. When the medium ruptures due to the laser, the elastic mem-
brane rapidly expands, exerting strong pressure on the drug. This 
causes it to be ejected through small nozzles at speeds ranging from 
as low as 150 m/s to over 800 m/s, with an average of approximately 
350 m/s.10–12 This speed is sufficient to penetrate the skin with liquid 
substances. Research combining laser wavelengths and media has 
shown that Er-­YAG Laser and moisture are an appropriate combina-
tion in terms of sustainability, reproducibility, and durability. Various 
efforts and expertise have been combined to maximize medium ab-
sorption and expansion, resulting in excellent efficiency of 10-­40 Hz. 
The shape of the sub-­chamber, like the upper chamber, has been 
designed over years of research to contain an appropriate volume of 
the drug while providing the best jet pressure discharge. Nozzle sizes 
ranging from 150 to 250 μm are achievable. The volume of drug that 
can be delivered at once is less than 1-­5 μL/shot, and delivery depth 
can reach approximately 100-­1500 μm.12 Additionally, overlapping 
shots on the same area allow for the delivery of a large amount of 
drug into deeper layers. Shooting obliquely at the same area induces 
exfoliation of the upper epidermis along with the drug, aiding in scar 
regeneration and preventing re-­adhesion. Plans for development in-
clude attaching injection needles or multi-­needles to the nozzle and 
eliminating intermediate barriers to simplify the structure, increase 
durability, and adjust temperature for use or artificially cooling for 
injection. These methods are expected to expand the scope of ap-
plication, overcoming the drawbacks of slow-­speed needle-­type au-
tomatic injectors.3,8,9
It has been confirmed that the powerful rupture phenomenon 
and heat generation in the upper chamber, which absorbs the laser in 
such systems, do not cause physical damage to sensitive drugs such 
as cytokines emitted from the lower chamber, even when ejected 
at high speeds for extended periods. It has been observed that the 
temperature in the lower chamber does not exceed 40–45°C even 
after prolonged high-­speed ejection.
Clinically, drugs with viscosities similar to non-­cross-­linked hy-
aluronic acid can be delivered to the dermis, and it is important to 
ensure uniform distribution of particles with different properties 
when mixed.13 The space where the drug is injected and dispersed 
is equipped with a reflux prevention valve system in the nozzle and 
drug injection port to ensure that the liquid drug progresses in one 
direction without backflow. Failure of these valves can significantly 
affect efficiency. It is essential to set the energy intensity stron-
ger than the typical injection energy and speed to facilitate the

37-­year-­old woman with abdominal striae 
distensae. The patient underwent a total 
of seven sessions. Initially, severity was 
rated as extremely severe on the SDSS 
(A), but after 32 weeks (B), it improved 
to moderate levels. The patient reported 
satisfaction with the outcome, scoring 1 
on a 4-­point questionnaire. However, she 
experienced side effects, including 4 days 
of bumpiness and 9 days of petechiae.

formation of initial jet pressure at around 10 Hz. This preparation 
for generating jet pressure can be considered the most crucial step 
in the procedure. When the jet pressure is well established, the drug 
is observed to be ejected rapidly with a high-­pitched sound, and the 
practitioner must be able to distinguish whether the high-­speed jet 
pressure is being maintained to perform the procedure effectively. 
Laser settings are generally more favorable with shorter pulse du-
rations, and selecting shorter pulses is advantageous for prolonged 
use. Operating with short pulse times is preferable as prolonged 
use can heat the medium and cause bubbles to form, leading to de-
creased efficiency.
The laser-­induced microjet technique facilitates the delivery of 
various drugs, allowing for the injection of all liquid medications 
approved for medical use. These agents can also be delivered by 
manually or using other injection devices, underscoring the need 
for more potent and specific drugs to enhance efficacy. To opti-
mize the effects of laser-­induced microjet, it is essential to employ 
a suitable formulation capable of rapid injection with solid compo-
nents. This approach maximizes the physical mechanotransduction 
effects on the dermis while ensuring a prolonged and safe duration 
of action. Clinically, excellent results have been observed using 
PDLLA agents featuring a rounded shape and mesh-­like internal 
structure, characteristics unattainable with manual or traditional 
drug delivery methods. While PDLLA has traditionally served as a 
filler for volume restoration in depressed scars, leveraging laser-­
induced microjet for rapid and precise injection yields superior 
results.
Poly-­L-­lactic acid (PLLA) and PDLLA, both classified as biode-
gradable collagen stimulators, have become increasingly popular in 
aesthetic medicine.14–18 PLLA with smaller particles demonstrates 
favorable effects on dermal regeneration, addressing concerns 
such as wrinkles, skin regeneration, whitening, erythema, improve-
ment of photoaging, and freckles. Conversely, PDLLA with larger 
particles is typically used for dermal volumization. A study by Seo 
et  al.16 investigated the efficacy and safety of injectable dermal 
PDLLA for skin rejuvenation. Their findings indicated statistically 
significant improvements in signs of aging skin post-­treatment, in-
cluding fine wrinkles, skin texture, irregular pigmentation, telan-
giectasia, and facial erythema post-­treatment. Moreover, diluting 
PDLLA slightly and adminstering it into the dermis in small amounts 
via the laser-­induced microjet system can produce excellent re-
sults, particularly in treating challenging depressed scars.19 This 
method allows for simultaneous delivery of the drug and mecha-
notransduction effects, especially beneficial in severe cases of SD 
characterized by extensive loss of elastic fibers, leading to positive 
clinical outcomes.
Furthermore, the separation of PDLLA particles within the 
dermis enhances the area surrounded by the extracellular matrix, 
promoting skin regeneration. The potential risk of foreign body re-
actions is offset by the minimal amount of PDLLA injected in a single 
shot, ensuring safety.
The rapid onset of action and mechanotranduction effects 
achieved with laser-­induced microjet, which are not attainable with 
manual injection methods, are likely to drive its widespread adoption 
among dermatologists in the future.
5  |  CONCLUSION
In conclusion, utilizing a needleless microjet injector with PDLLA 
presents a viable therapeutic option for treating SD. Typically, 
achieving satisfactory outcomes entails an average of 5–7 treatment 
sessions. Mild petechiae may commonly occur as a side effect.
