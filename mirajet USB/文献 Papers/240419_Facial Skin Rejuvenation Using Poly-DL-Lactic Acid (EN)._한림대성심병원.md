BACKGROUND A laser-induced needle-free microjet injector was developed for rapid, high-speed drug delivery of
microliters into the skin.
OBJECTIVE This study evaluated the clinical rejuvenation effect of repeated dermal injections of the collagen simulator
poly-DL-lactic acid (PDLA) using a laser-induced needle-free microjet injector.
METHODS Five PDLA injection sessions using a laser-induced needle-free microjet injector were conducted in patients
concerned about aging skin. Facial uplifting, darkness, redness, roughness, pore size, subjective satisfaction, and side
effects were evaluated before each session and 4 weeks after treatment completion. Histological evaluation was also
performed with immunohistochemical staining of collagen and elastic fibers.
RESULTS The clinical results of 27 female patients were evaluated. The treatment resulted in a noticeable skin surface
uplifting (0.711 6 0.42 mm) and significant improvements in darkness (p 5 .013), redness (p 5 .009), and roughness (p 5
.036), with no significant difference in the pore size (p 5 .770). Patients were reported being satisfied with the overall
therapeutic effects, despite mild and tolerable adverse effects. Histological findings revealed growth and thickening of
collagen and elastic fibers, with marked increase in collagen I and III levels.
CONCLUSION Repeated dermal injections of PDLA using a laser-induced microjet injector offer excellent drug delivery,
achieving high efficacy in skin rejuvenation, patient satisfaction, and safety.
A
s life expectancy increases, the desire to maintain
a beautiful appearance for extended periods inten-
sifies. With the increasing interest in antiaging,
various procedures have been developed, including laser
skin resurfacing, intense pulse light therapy, chemical peels,
dermabrasion, microneedling, dermal fillers, and botuli-
num toxin therapy. Among these interventions, poly-DL-
lactic acid (PDLA) mesotherapy, a type of polylactic acid
(PLA) filler, stands out as a remarkable option.
Poly-DL-lactic acid is an US Food and Drug Admin-
istration–approved filler medication with proven long-
term (24 months) safety and efficacy and used for various
applications such as scar treatment and skin rejuvena-
tion.1 Manually administering PDLA with conventional
syringes poses challenges in delivering minute, even
amounts of the drug across the entire thin dermis.
Consequently, drug delivery devices, such as mesoguns
or microneedle systems, employing multiple small needles
to uniformly administer a predetermined quantity of
medication at a consistent depth, have been developed for
various drug injections.2–4 However, the use of needles
for drug injections induces pain and requires a recovery
period from injection-related wounds and irritation.
Patients increasingly prefer noninvasive or minimally
invasive treatments.
The recently developed laser-induced needle-free jet
injector (NFJI), which converts laser light energy into
kinetic pressure for drug delivery, is gaining attention owing
to its ability to administer minute drug quantities evenly
into the dermis without the use of needles.5 Although
previous studies at this institution have explored the effects
of intradermal injection of PDLA through microneedle
radiofrequency, reports on the clinical outcomes and side
effects of PDLA therapy administered through the laser-
induced NFJI are lacking.4 Therefore, the authors in-
vestigated the efficacy and safety of PDLA injections using
the laser-induced NFJI.

who consented to clinical trial participation. A single
dermatologist performed all procedures. Exclusion criteria
comprised individuals who had undergone cosmetic proce-
dures, including laser therapy, peeling, botulinum toxin
injection, or fillers within the past 6 months; pregnant
women; and those with treatment site infections, facial
dermatitis, known PDLA allergy, or a keloid history. The
study protocol adhered to the ethical guidelines outlined in
the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed consent was
obtained from all participating patients.
Treatment Device
The laser-induced NFJI (Mirajet; JSK Biomed, Daejeon,
Korea) operates as a transdermal drug delivery system,
injecting drugs without needles, by converting intense light
energy from an Er:YAG laser into kinetic pressure
(Figure 1). When the laser focuses on the water in the
cylinder, it induces cavitation, leading to the generation of
powerful pressure that pushes the elastic membrane out-
ward. This sequence produces a microjet of the drug,
allowing for dermal drug delivery without the use of
needles.
Poly-DL-Lactic Acid Dermal Filler
The collagen stimulator used in this study is the PDLA filler
(Juvelook,
VAIM,
Korea),
a
formulation
combining
42.5 mg of PDLA with 7.5 mg of hyaluronic acid.
Protocol
Patients underwent 5 PDLA injection sessions using the PDLA
dermal filler at 3- to 4-week intervals. All treatments were
performed by a single dermatologist identically following the
outlined protocol. A local anesthetic cream ([eutectic mixture
of local anesthetics] EMLA, lidocaine 2.5%, and prilocaine
2.5%) was applied before the procedure to alleviate pain.
Two hours before treatment, the authors diluted 16 mg
of PDLA in 3 cc of normal saline by vortexing. Laser settings
included a 200 mm-sized nozzle, operating at 30 Hz
frequency, with the Er:YAG laser power set between 70
and 90 mJ. Each treatment session employed a painting
technique used in laser toning, delivering the injection
across the entire facial area in 2 to 3 passes until dispensing
a total of 3 cc of the diluted PDLA solution. This process
involved approximately 15,000 pulses per session, with
each pulse delivering 0.2 mL of the solution into the skin at

jet speed. No other treatments were done to the face until the
completion of all sessions.
Clinical Assessment
Photographs of the patients were taken at baseline,
immediately after each treatment session, and 4 weeks after
the final session using a Nikon D40 camera (Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan) for comprehensive assessment. Patients also un-
derwent A-one Lite imaging (Bomtec, Seoul, Korea) for
a detailed analysis of specific clinical changes such as vessels
and pigmentation and 3D imaging (LifeViz Mini; Quanti-
ficare, Sophia Antipolis, France). All the photographs were
taken by the same photographer, and 2 dermatologists
exempted from previous treatments assessed the clinical
images after treatment.
Skin darkness, redness, roughness, and pore size were
evaluated on a 5-point scale (0 5 none, 1 5 mild, 2 5
moderate, 3 5 severe, and 4 5 very severe).6 Overall
improvement was assessed using the Global Aesthetic
Improvement Scale (GAIS; 1 5 exceptional improvement;
2 5 very improved; 3 5 improved; 4 5 unaltered; and 5 5
worsened). In the before-and-after evaluation process of the
study, the raters were successfully blinded to the chrono-
logical sequence of the photographs.
Furthermore, the dermatologists evaluated the facial
uplifting effects by analyzing vector changes using the 3D
image program. This program automatically compared
before-and-after photographs captured with a 3D camera,
evaluating the extent of lifting in millimeters for each area of
the entire facial region and illustrating it with yellow
arrows. To conduct an objective comparative analysis, the
face was categorized into 6 groups: left and right upper
cheeks (periorbital area), midcheek, and lower cheek
(perioral area). A representative yellow arrow, termed the
“landmark vector,” was chosen for each area. The sizes (in
mm) of these vectors were aggregated, and the authors
referred to this averaged vector change as “3D pixel
movement.” Size variations were quantified as positive
values when the vector pointed against gravity and negative
values when it pointed towards gravity. Side effects such as
erythema, bruising, swelling, itching, burning sensation,
altered sensation, and postinflammatory hyperpigmenta-
tion were also evaluated immediately after each treatment.
Subjective Assessment of the Patients
One month after completion of the 5-session treatment,
patient satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point scale
questionnaire (0 5 no improvement; 1 5 1%–25%
improvement; 2 5 26%–50% improvement; 3 5 51%–
75% improvement; and 4 5 76%–100% improvement).
Pain was evaluated immediately after treatment using the
visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10
(worst and excruciating pain), and postprocedural down-
time was investigated.
Histological Assessment
Two consenting patients underwent 2 mm skin biopsies in
the postauricular area adjacent to the treated skin before
and 4 weeks after completion of the 5-session treatment.
Tissue samples were collected and evaluated for dermal
changes by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson’s
trichrome, and Verhoeff–van Gieson staining. Collagen I
and III staining (Novus Bio., Centennial, CO) was also
performed for a detailed examination of the dermal collagen
composition. The authors used ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD) for quantitative analysis of histological
changes within the dermis. This software enabled a com-
prehensive assessment of staining levels for structural
components such as collagen, collagen I, collagen III, and
elastin fibers, which exhibited distinct staining character-
istics. By customizing this analysis with ImageJ, the authors
effectively measured area fractions of stained collagen and
elastin fibers.
Statistical Analysis
A paired t-test was conducted to assess changes before and
after treatment. SPSS for Windows (version 26.0) was used
for statistical analysis, and p , .05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Patient Characteristics
All 27 patients who successfully completed the 5 sessions
were exclusively Korean females with an average age of
48.56 6 10.90 years. The Fitzpatrick skin types were
classified in 13 individuals as type III and 14 as type IV
(Table 1).
Clinical Assessment
Table 2 provides a comprehensive objective assessment of
skin rejuvenation. Skin darkness, redness, and roughness
demonstrated statistically significant positive responses, as
presented in Figures 2 and 3 (2.500 vs 2.042, p 5 .013;
2.083 vs 1.542, p 5 .009; and 2.333 vs 1.958, p 5 .036,
respectively). Although the pore size improved after
treatment, the difference was not statistically significant
(2.208 vs 2.166; p 5 .770). 3D pixel movement for face
lifting revealed a prominent positive response, with no
movement in 4 individuals, 0 to 1 mm in 14 individuals, 1 to
2 mm in 6 individuals, and 2 mm or more in 3 individuals
(Figure 4). The average observed movement was 0.711 6
0.42 mm. With an average score of 2.208 6 1.190, the
GAIS indicates a “very improved” overall treatment effect.
Some patients had tolerable side effects, with 3 individuals

exhibiting mild erythema during the procedure, which
resolved spontaneously within an average recovery down-
time of 1.933 6 0.346 days. In addition, 6 individuals
experienced mild folliculitis, but all cases improved within
5 days of topical antibiotic application. No other side effects
were reported, such as bruising, swelling, itching, burning
sensation,
altered
sensation,
or
postinflammatory
hyperpigmentation.
Subjective Assessment of the Patients
The 5-point scale that assessed subjective patient responses
yielded an average score of 2.542 6 1.079 (Table 2);
particularly, on average, the patients perceived 26% to
50% improvement after 5 sessions. In addition, the VAS
scores for pain after each session averaged around 1.118 6
0.185, indicating minimal discomfort.
Histopathological Findings
Skin biopsies were conducted on 2 patients through H&E
staining, Verhoeff–van Gieson staining, and Masson’s
trichrome staining before and after treatment with PDLA
injected with a needleless injector. After treatment, H&E
staining revealed an overall increase and thickening of
dermal collagen bundles (Figure 5A,B). Verhoeff–van
Gieson and Masson’s trichrome staining also revealed
increased thickness and density of collagen and elastin fibers
in the papillary dermis and mid-dermis after treatment, with
no evidence of granuloma formation (Figure 5C–F). After
treatment, collagen I and III levels increased pronouncedly
(Figure 5G,H). Quantitative analysis using ImageJ for
collagen, collagen I, collagen III, and elastic fibers in the
dermis demonstrated increased proportions of all these
elements after treatment, as outlined in Table 3.
Discussion
Based on clinical and histological findings, the study
demonstrated that PDLA injections using a laser-induced
microjet injector totaling 5 sessions are an effective
treatment option for skin rejuvenation, minimizing pain
and other adverse effects.
In skin rejuvenation mesotherapy, a broad spectrum of
agents is used, including vitamins, enzymes, hormones, and
plant extracts, as well as specialized compounds such as
hyaluronic acid, exosomes, polynucleotides, and PLA.
Polylactic acid, an eco-friendly biodegradable polymer,
promotes collagen synthesis and increases skin volume
when injected into the skin.7–9 Poly-DL-lactic acid, a type of
PLA with an average particle size of 30 mm and a round
foam structure, facilitates smooth injection into the human
skin, while minimizing side effects such as palpable nodules.
In animal study, it was demonstrated that PDLA modulates
macrophages to promote the proliferation of adipose-
derived stem cells, ultimately leading to increased collagen
synthesis.10 Several clinical studies have validated the
capacity of PDLA for collagen synthesis in scar and
rejuvenation treatments, using various injection methods
including manual needle injection, microneedle fractional
radiofrequency
devices,
mesotherapy
injectors,
and
NFJIs.4,11–13 In a recent study, 3 individuals undergoing
needle-free jet injections of PDLA for atrophic acne scars
exhibited noticeable skin rejuvenation effects.11 In addition,
a split-face study revealed enhanced skin hydration and
elasticity following a single session of PDLA injection using

the NFJI; however, no significant alterations were observed
in texture, wrinkles, and pores.12 On the contrary, this
study confirmed significant improvements in darkness,
redness, and roughness after 5 sessions of PDLA injection
using the NFJI, along with an observable face uplifting
effect. The results suggest that undergoing multiple sessions,
rather than just 1, could potentially amplify the rejuvenat-
ing effects of PDLA injections through the NFJI. Further
studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis and to
determine the optimal number of sessions.
The effectiveness of this treatment method in rejuvena-
tion implies that PDLA is efficiently injected through the
NFJI. In a cadaver study using the laser-induced NFJI for
PDLA injection, the histological findings demonstrated
precise drug delivery into the papillary dermal layer (depth
of 300 mm).5 Another study using a laser system for the
NFJI reported that the delivery efficiency of various
viscosities, ranging from 1 to 58 MDa, into artificial skin
was 78% to 95% when injected at 13–27 mL/pulse.14
Considering the injection of 140-kDa polymer PDLA in this
treatment at 0.2 mL/pulse, the authors infer that the
treatment also exhibits high delivery efficiency after
observing the histological changes in the papillary dermis
and mid-dermis after treatment. During PDLA injection
through the NFJI, optimal jet power settings should be
established. Excessive jet power may lead to side effects such
as pain, bleeding, and skin damage. The jet power varies
depending on the nozzle diameter and jet velocity,
influencing jet penetration, dispersion, and quantitative
delivery of the jet.15 Cofactors such as the mechanical
properties of the skin, jet volume, and standoff distance also
contribute to drug delivery. As the standoff distance
increases, the material ejected from the nozzle tip accelerates
even further before reaching the skin, ultimately resulting in
a faster injection speed into the dermis. Lifting the device tip
off the skin during the procedure may allow for easier
control of the device’s handpiece and thus shorten the
procedure time but could increase jet velocity, causing more
pain, bleeding, and skin damage. Therefore, the authors
conducted the procedure with the device tip nearly touching
the skin. Using this technique, they were able to achieve
therapeutic effects while avoiding adverse effects such as
swelling or holes.
The injection of PDLA using the NFJI synergistically
enhanced the PDLA effectiveness. Some authors have
proposed that microtrauma from drug injection through
the NFJI induces a healing response, potentially extending
the dermal changes caused by PDLA.16 In addition, NFJI-
assisted PDLA injections offer advantages concerning side
effects, pain, downtime, and procedure time, thereby
enhancing patient compliance. A study on porcine tissue
revealed that an infinitesimal injection volume of the
microjet minimizes tissue destruction, consequently re-
ducing the side effects.14 This procedure also demonstrated
only tolerable side effects, and the microjet facilitated the
even injection of minute amounts of PDLA, preventing side
effects such as granulation from excessive PDLA injection.
In another study by the team, the procedure of injecting
PDLA using a microneedle fractional radiofrequency device
for acne scars resulted in an average VAS score of 3.9 6 1.3

procedure was 2.62 6 1.03 days,4 contrary to the VAS score
of 1.118 6 0.185, indicating less pain, and the decreased
downtime of 1.933 6 0.346 days in this study. In a split-face
study that confirmed the clinical effects of PDLA injection
using the laser-induced NFJI, the reported VAS score for
pain was 5.39 6 2.01.12 Unlike the administration of 3 cc
across the entire face, the increased pain reported in the
split-face study was attributed to the 2-cc injection on half
the face, utilizing a slightly higher output energy of 100
mJ. Moreover, the procedure in this study, averaging
approximately 5 minutes to administer a single ampul of
PDLA, is generally time efficient.12,14 In summary, the
benefits of reduced side effects, diminished pain, shorter
recovery time, and faster procedure durations considerably
alleviate patient concerns about receiving the treatment.
Consequently, the repeated dermal injection of PDLA
through the laser-induced NFJI emerges as an optimal
treatment choice for skin rejuvenation, benefiting from the
synergistic impact and enhanced patient compliance.
This study had several limitations. First, given the limited
number of biopsies, additional investigation with more
extensive biopsy sample sizes is required. Second, all
enrolled participants were Korean females with skin types
III and IV, precluding the evaluation of males and
individuals of other races. Third, the analysis of the study
outcomes displayed a partial lack of objectivity. At last, this
study did not observe outcomes beyond 1 year. However,
clinico-histological evaluations were conducted after the
theoretical period for collagen boosting with PDLA, thereby
attributing importance to the findings.
Conclusion
A laser-induced microjet injector with PDLA is a suitable
treatment option for facial rejuvenation in patients with
skin types III and IV. This drug delivery system allows
precise control over the depth and quantity of drug
injection, enabling rapid administration without needle
usage. This results in minimal pain and side effects and
reduced downtime, ultimately achieving satisfactory thera-
peutic outcomes. It can be an optimal treatment option for
patients with sensitive skin, needle phobia, or pain
concerns.
