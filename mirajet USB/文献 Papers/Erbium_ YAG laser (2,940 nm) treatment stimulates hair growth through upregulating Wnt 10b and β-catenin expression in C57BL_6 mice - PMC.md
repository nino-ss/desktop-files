Abstract
Aim: To evaluate the role of 2,940 nm erbium: YAG laser in hair growth in C57BL/6 mice.
Methods: Anagen was experimentally induced by depilation. Healthy C57BL/6 mice (n=22)
were randomly divided into four groups, with treatment of laser or minoxidil, or with com‐
bined laser and minoxidil treatments. The skin color of each mouse was observed each day.
The time from telogen (pink skin color) to anagen (black coloration) phase and from anagen
(black coloration) to catagen (all hairs grew out of the depilated skin) have been recorded.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) assay was done at fifteen days after the first treatment for each
group to observe hair follicles and hair cycle score. Western blot analysis was utilized to detect
the expression levels of Wnt 10-b and β-catenin. Results: Black pigmentation started signifi‐
cantly earlier both in the laser and combination group than in the control group. Moreover, the
time from anagen to catagen in the laser, minoxidil and combination groups were all signifi‐
cantly shorter from the control group. Histopathology with H&E staining showed an obvious
increase in the number of hair follicles in the anagen phase caused by the treatment of 2,940
nm erbium: YAG laser and minoxidil. Similarly, the percentage of hair follicles in anagen VI ac‐
counted for 19.5%, 37.5%, 41.5% and 44% in control, laser, minoxidil, and combination group,
respectively. Western blot analysis showed that both the levels of Wnt 10b and β-catenin were
significantly increased by the treatment of 2,940 nm erbium: YAG laser. Conclusion: Our find‐
ings showed that 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser could promote hair growth by inducing hair cycle
transition from telogen to anagen phases in C57BL/6 mice through up regulating Wnt 10b and
β-catenin. These results suggest that 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser may be a potential therapy for
hair loss.

Hair loss is generally considered not to be a life-threatening event. However, it often has impact
on social interactions and people’s psychological well-being. Hair is considered as one of the
accessory structures of integument which include sebaceous glands, nails and sweet glands.
The growth of hair is cyclic with three different phases, including phases of growth (anagen),
involution (catagen) and rest (telogen) [1,2].
Though the number of patients suffering from hearing loss has increased dramatically, only
two drugs-finasteride and minoxidil-have been approved to be used in the treatment of hair
loss so far. Minoxidil is widely used for androgenic alopecia patients to promote hair growth
through inducing stage transition for hair follicles from telogen stages into anagen stages [3].
However, the adverse dermatological effects, such as scaling, dryness and dermatitis, would
also be caused by minoxidil administration [4,5]. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel
treatments.
Laser and light sources have been widely used medically and non-medically for many years. It
has been well known that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) seems to be effective and safe in the
treatment of hair loss. Various LLLT have been reported to treat hair loss, such as He-Ne laser,
excimer laser, and PUVA, and some successful cases have been reported [6-8]. Besides LLLT,
high-energy lasers have also been tried in the treatment of hair loss. Lee et al. reported a 1550
nm fractional erbium-glass laser in the treatment of female pattern hair loss [9]. Their results
suggest that high-energy laser 1550 nm fractional erbium-glass laser may be an effective and
safe treatment option for women with female pattern hair loss. Although the mechanism of
laser induced hair growth has not been well elucidated, the great potential of various types of
lasers in the treatment hair loss has been verified. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role
of 2,940-nm erbium: YAG laser treatment in the hair growth in mice.
Materials and methods
Animals
Healthy C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old, weighted 20-30 g) were obtained from Laboratory
Animals Center of Wuhan University. Mice 6-8 weeks old mice were used for subsequent exper‐
iments since mice at this stage are in the telogen stage of the hair cycle [10]. Mice were given
rodent chow and water ad libitum, with humidity (35-60%), temperature (23±2°C), and 12 h
light and 12 h darkness cycles. The animal care and experiments were performed in accor‐
dance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health
Publication Number 80-23) and institutional ethical guidelines for animal experiment of
Wuhan University.
Anagen induction
As previously described [10], anagen was experimentally induced by depilation. Briefly, all mice
were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% chloral hydrate at a dose of 0.1 ml/10 g
body weight of mice. All hair follicles were indicated in telogen by the pink back skin color [11].

A wax/rosin mixture was applied to dorsal skin (about 4 cm × 4 cm), and all hair shafts were
removed through peeling off the wax/rosin mixture. It has been reported that removal of all
hair shafts immediately induces a highly synchronized hair growth [12,13].
Treatment
Mice were randomly divided into four groups (n=22) to study the hair promoting activity.
Dorsal skin was cleaned before treatment for all groups. The control group did not receive any
treatment. In the group of laser treatment, treatment was carried out using a 2,940-nm Er: YAG
laser (Pixel, Alma Lasers Ltd, Caesarea, Israel) with a microlens aligned in a matrix of 9 × 9
(81) dots (pixels) at a setting of 1200 mJ/cm  and a spot area of 1.5 cm × 4.0 cm. Two laser
passes were performed during each treatment session. Each mouse received 3 treatments at
one-week interval. In the group of minoxidil treatment, 5% Minoxidil Tincture (Wanma Group,
Zhejiang, China) was treated each day and lasting for 3 weeks. In the group combined laser
treatment with minoxidil, the number of passes, matrix size, and the level of energy used for
2,940-nm Er: YAG laser treatment was the same as the laser treatment group; in the meantime,
5% Minoxidil Tincture (Wanma Group, China) was treated each day and lasting for 3 weeks.
The skin color of each mouse was observed each day. Anagen was indicated by the black col‐
oration. In our study, we used black coloration covering about half of the depilated skin area as
the sign of anagen. The time interval between telogen (treatment beginning) and anagen has
been recorded. Moreover, we had also recorded the time interval between anagen and catagen
(all hairs grew out of the depilated skin).
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) assay
Fifteen days after the first treatments for each group, four mice from each group were sacri‐
ficed and dorsal skin was excised. Dorsal skin was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for at
least 24 hours and embedded in paraffin blocks to obtain longitudinal and transverse section.
Stain the sliced sections with hematoxylin and eosin. Representative areas were selected from
digital photomicrographs at a fixed magnification of 400 ×.
Hair cycle score
The H&E stained slides were photographed using a digital photomicrograph to evaluate hair
cycles. Fifty hair follicles identified on sections were graded for each mouse. Hair cycle score
was calculated as following: hair follicles in anagen VI were attributed a sore of 100, in early
catagen (catagen I-catagen III) a score of 200, in mid-catagen (catagen IV-catagen V) a score of
300, and in late catagen (catagen VI-VIII) a score of 400. The percentage of each hair cycle
stage was also calculated.
Western blotting
Methods for western blot were as previously described [14]. Briefly, proteins were extracted
from tissue samples at 24 hours after the first treatments for each group, and quantified by
Bradford assay [15]. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The primary antibodies used for western blot

were biotin polyclonal rabbit anti-Wnt 10b antibody (bs-3662r; 1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and monoclonal rabbit anti-β-catenin (#9582; 1:1000 dilu‐
tion; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA). All experiments were repeated three times.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD. Data was analyzed by SPSS software (version 17.0).
Statistical evaluation of the data was performed using One-way Analysis-of-variance (ANOVA)
test, followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test. The values P<0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
Results
Effect of 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser on hair growth
Mice aged at 6-8 weeks old were synchronized by depilation. The transition of hair follicles
from telogen to anagen phase was indicated by the black pigmentation. Our results showed
that time length for the beginning of black pigmentation was significantly different in four
groups (Table 1; Figure 1, left). As shown in the Figure 1, black pigmentation started signifi‐
cantly earlier in the laser and minoxidil group than in the control group, suggesting that 2,940-
nm Er: YAG laser induced black coloration for C57BL/6 mice. In the combination group (with
both laser treatments and minoxidil administration), the time took from telogen to anagen
phase was significantly shorter than that in the control group. Moreover, the time from anagen
(black skin color) to catagen (all hairs grew out of the depilated skin) was recorded for each
group. Our results showed that the time from anagen to catagen in the laser, minoxidil and
combination groups were all significantly shorter from the control group (Table 1; Figure 1,
right). The time from anagen to catagen in the combination group was significantly shorter
than that in the minoxidil group, suggesting combined treatment of 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser and
minoxidil could further stimulated hair growth.

was 158, suggesting the majority of hair follicles was in anagen phase or early catagen phase.
Whereas, hair cycle score for the laser group was 336, suggesting the majority of hair follicles
was in mid-catagen phase or late catagen phase. Through calculating the percentage of hair fol‐
licles in each hair cycle stage, we found that follicles in anagen VI accounted for 19.5%, 37.5%,
41.5% and 44% in control, laser, minoxidil and combination group, respectively (Table 2).

2,940-nm Er: YAG laser treatment induced the expression of Wnt 10b and β-catenin
The mechanism underlying transition of hair cycle growth from telogen to anagen has not been
well understood. However, many signaling pathways have been reported to be involved in this
transition, such as Wnt, BMP, Shh, and FGF [16-18]. β-catenin has been reported that could in‐
duce the hair growth cycle transition from the telogen to anagen phases [19-21]. It has also
been report that Wnt 10b may induce the transition from telogen to anagen via a canonical
Wnt signaling pathways to promote hair follicle growth [22]. In this study, in order to elucidate
the mechanism of 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser treatment in the hair growth, western blot analysis
was used to detect expression level of Wnt 10b and β-catenin. In our study, we found that the
levels of Wnt 10b were significantly higher in the laser, minoxidil and combination groups than
in control group. Moreover, levels of β-catenin were higher in the laser and combination
groups than in control group. While, no difference was observed in the minoxidil group com‐
pared with control group (Figure 3). Taking together, these data indicated that 2,940-nm Er:
YAG laser treatment promoted hair growth partly through upregulating Wnt 10b and β-catenin.

Discussion
Hair loss is one of the most common chronic dermatological problems worldwide. Multiple rea‐
sons may cause hair loss, such as genetic heredity, levels of local androgen, sleep, and sebum
secretion. Though not a life-threatening event, hair loss often may often have significant psy‐
cho-social consequences especially in younger people. Minoxidil is a widely used drug ap‐
proved by FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) to treat androgenic alopecia through induc‐
ing hair cycle transition from telogen to anagen phases [23]. However, adverse dermatogogical
effects such as dryness, local irritation and dermatitis may be also caused by minoxidil treat‐
ment [4].
Laser therapy seems to be effective and safe in the treatment of hair loss, though the mecha‐
nism underlying is not well elucidated. LLLT, such as He-Ne laser, excimer laser, and PUVA, have
been reported to be effective in the treatment of hair loss [6-8]. Unlike LLLT, use of high-energy
lasers in the treatment of hail loss has been relatively less reported. Lee et al. reported a 1550
nm fractional erbium-glass laser in the treatment of female pattern hair loss and found that the
treatment may be an effective and safe treatment option for women with female pattern hair
loss [9]. Ablative fractional Er: YAG laser (2,940 nm) has been reported to be a promising op‐
tion for skin resurface and traumatic scars reduction [24,25]. However, the role of 2,940-nm

Er: YAG laser in hair growth has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that 2,940-nm Er:
YAG laser could significantly promote hair growth via inducing hair cycle transition from telo‐
gen to anagen phases in C57BL/6 mice.
C57BL/6 mice are useful models used for the screening of hair growth promoting agents. The
black pigment is only produced during anagen, making the skin color as a visible indicator for
hair cycles. Our results showed that black pigmentation started significantly earlier in the laser
group than in the control group, suggesting that 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser induced transition tel‐
ogen to anagen in C57BL/6 mice. In the group treated with both 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser and
minoxidil, the time took from telogen to anagen phase was significantly shorter than both con‐
trol and laser groups. These results may be partially caused by the increased absorption of mi‐
noxidil after ablative fractional Er: YAG laser (2,940 nm) treatment. It has been reported that
Er: YAG laser treatment could enhance absorption of transdermal peptides delivery for 3-140
folds compared with intact skin [26]. Further, histopathology with H&E staining at 15 days after
the first treatment for each group showed an obvious increase in the number of hair follicles in
the anagen phase in the laser, minoxidil and combination group compared with that in the con‐
trol group. The anagen hair bulbs were larger in groups with treatment (laser, minoxidil, and
combination group) compared to the control group. Our results suggest that 2,940-nm Er: YAG
laser treatment promotes hair growth through inducing hair cycle transition from telogen to
anagen phases in C57BL/6 mice.
Many signaling pathways have been reported to be involved in transition of hair cycle growth
from telogen to anagen, such as Wnt, BMP, Shh, and FGF [16-18]. It has been report that Wnt
10b may induce the transition from telogen to anagen via a canonical Wnt signaling pathways
to promote hair follicle growth [22]. In this study, we found that both the levels of Wnt 10b and
β-catenin were significantly higher in the laser, minoxidil and combination groups than in con‐
trol group. Taking together, these data indicated that 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser treatment pro‐
moted hair growth partially through upregulating Wnt 10b and β-catenin.
Conclusion
In this study, we report the role of 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser in hair growth. Our findings suggest
that 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser could promote hair growth by inducing hair cycle transition from
telogen to anagen phases in C57BL/6 mice through upregulating Wnt 10b and β-catenin. Our
results suggest that 2,940-nm Er: YAG laser may be a potential therapy for hair loss.
