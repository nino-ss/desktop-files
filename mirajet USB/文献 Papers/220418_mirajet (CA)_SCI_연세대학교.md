Abstract
The skin barrier effectively inhibits the penetration of substances; therefore, drug
delivery, especially the delivery of drugs that are hydrophilic, through the skin, is
challenging. Objectives: Physicians in the esthetic field now use the transdermal drug
delivery system to attempt to deliver esthetic materials, such as hyaluronic acid and
poly-DL-lactic acid into the skin. Conventionally, esthetic physicians manually
injected these materials using needle syringes into the dermis layer. However, the
injection is often irregular, imprecise, slow, and painful. Injector devices have been
developed to overcome these limitations. A total of five Korean cadavers (that of
three men and two women with a mean age of 69.2 years; range, 60–73 years)
underwent laser injection. We used a device called Er:YAG LASER to create the pres-
sure needed for microjet delivery to the skin of the cadaver. Discussion: In this study,
the first LASER pressure-based, needle-free microjet injector was used to deliver
drugs effectively into the dermis of a cadaver. This study showed that a novel
needle-free microjet injector using Er:YAG LASER can introduce beneficial, liquid,
esthetic drugs into the papillary dermal layer (depth of 300um) with minimal epider-
mal damage.

INTRODUCTION
The skin is composed of three layers: epidermis, dermis, and subcuta-
neous fat. Among them, the epidermal layer is located on the outer-
most surface. Among the epidermal layers, the outermost layer is
called the skin barrier. The skin barrier plays important roles, such as
maintaining water balance and preventing the invasion of bacteria and
foreign substances. Because of its lipophilic structure, the skin barrier
is especially protective against hydrophilic substances. However, such
characteristics are not favorable in terms of esthetic medicine because
some drugs are introduced into the dermis for their beneficial effects
are ironically blocked by the skin barrier. In other words, the skin bar-
rier decreases the absorption rate of hydrophilic drugs that are effec-
tive for the skin.
Physicians in the esthetic field have developed a method called
mesotherapy to effectively deliver cosmetic substances into the
Jong-Jin Lee and Kyu-Ho Yi contributed equally.

dermis. (El-Domyati et al., 2012; Tedeschi et al., 2015) Mesotherapy
utilizes micro-sized needles to pierce the skin barrier and make direct
injections into the dermis. This allows drugs to bypass the process of
absorption through the skin barrier. Mesotherapy has, therefore, been
very popular, but there are disadvantages in that it is irregular, inaccu-
rate, slow, and painful as the injection is manually performed.
(Konda & Thappa, 2013).
To overcome such disadvantages, needle injectors, such as the
messogun (Choi et al., 2020), have been developed. Compared to the
manually performed injections, the needle injector performs more reg-
ular and accurate injections. (Srinivas et al., 2017) There remain a few
problems; however, as the injection is as slow and painful as when
manually performed. Nevertheless, with no suitable alternatives, phy-
sicians prefer the use of such injection devices.
An Er:YAG laser is used to generate vapor bubbles, converts
laser energy into pressure to deliver drugs to the skin in the form
of a jet. A microjet is generated by an expansion of the vapor bub-
bles induced by the focused laser beam as illustrated in Figure 1.
(Jang et al., 2014) It is possible to inject a small amount of drug
evenly into the dermal layer. Because the laser does not directly
touch the skin, it is the most important feature to deliver a dose
of drug quickly and effectively at regular intervals without thermal
heating.
The main objective of this study was to determine the effective-
ness of the Er:YAG LASER in creating the pressure needed for micro-
jet delivery. We examined whether the drug was effectively inserted
into the dermal layer by observing the tissue samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was performed in accordance with the principles outlined
in the Declaration of Helsinki. Appropriate consent and approval were
obtained from the families of cadavers before the experiment was
conducted. A total of five Korean cadavers (that of three men and
two women with a mean age of 69.2 years; range, 60–73 years)
underwent laser injection.
We used a device called Er:YAG LASER to create the pressure
needed for microjet delivery to the skin of the cadaver. The laser
pulse mode was set to 40us, the operating frequency to 10 Hz or
40 Hz, and the output energy to 600 mJ. Hyaluronic acid (HA) mixed
with dye and poly-DL-lactic acid (PDLA, itemized name Juberuc) was
injected into both sides of the forehead, the periocular, the cheek, and
the perioral areas. After confirming through observation with the
naked eye that the dye-mixed substances had been injected suffi-
ciently into the cadaver, the tissue samples from the injected areas
were incised and collected. The collected tissue samples were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin and observed using an optical microscope
under 50 and 100 magnification, respectively.
This study was conducted in compliance with the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki. Consent was received from the patients
and families of the deceased cadaver prior the procedure and dissec-
tions. The exclusion criteria for this study included pregnancy, history
of drug allergy, other serious medical conditions, or surgical or non-
surgical treatment of the facial area (including HA filler) within the
previous 6 months. All subjects received a sufficient explanation of
the study purpose and protocols, and they were free to withdraw
from the treatment and research at any time. After the anatomical
experiment one clinical cases have been presented with the exact
same procedures. In addition, the patient satisfaction was assessed
according to the “very satisfied,” “satisfied,” “disappointed,” and “very
disappointed” scales with a self-report questionnaire at the last visit.

RESULTS
As observed with the naked eye, punctures from the laser injections
were not visible on the surface of the skin. When the tissue samples
were observed under the microscope, it was observed that the HA
and PDLA substances had penetrated through the epidermal layer and
were localized in the upper dermis at a depth of 300um (Figure 2).
This result was the same for all 10 sides (from five cadavers) of the
forehead, the periocular, the cheek, and the perioral areas of the tis-
sue samples. The injection cycle at 10 Hz or 40 Hz confirmed that the

absorption uniformly reached at the same level of the papillary dermis.
The shape of the localized HA or PDLA inserted was oval in shape in
the papillary dermal layer (Figure 3). As observed with the naked eye,
no visible damage was observed on the epidermal layers.

DISCUSSION
In this study, the performance of the Er:YAG laser injector is demon-
strated. This device utilizes a laser to vaporize cosmetic substances
and create pressure from this process to disseminate cosmetic sub-
stances into the skin in the form of microjets. Compared to clear holes
made by mesotherapy or messogun (Srinivas et al., 2017), the damage
to the epidermis is hardly visible to the naked eye in the tissue
specimens. This suggests that the laser device minimizes damage to
the epidermis.
The papillary dermis is considered to be the best target for injec-
tion of cosmetic materials because it is a layer where esthetic effects,
such as collagen stimulation, can be maximized (Srinivas et al., 2017;
Zhou et al., 2020). The laser device penetration was at a depth of
300um, which is the upper part of the dermis. In addition, regardless
of whether the operating frequency was 10 Hz or 40 Hz, it was con-
firmed that the absorption uniformly reached at the same level as

A limitation of this study is that the outcome from a pre-fixed
cadaver may be different from that obtained in living human tissues.
The tissue of the cadaver loses its elasticity and consistency over time
after death. In future studies, to overcome this limitation, a method
such as injecting a substance like HA into a living person and observ-
ing the effect using high-resolution ultrasound.

Case 1
A 44-year-old man presented with a severe abdominal striae distensae.
A preliminary clinical photograph showed prominent striae distensae in
the abdominal region. The Er:YAG LASER microjet injector was used to
inject PDLA. On day 2 months after the injection, the bruise and swelling
were well removed. The scar tissue was lightened (Figure 4). This volun-
teer responded as “satisfied” in the patient satisfaction questionnaire.

CONCLUSION
This study showed that a novel needle-free microjet injector using Er:
YAG LASER can introduce beneficial, liquid, esthetic drugs into the papil-
lary dermal layer (depth of 300 um) with minimal epidermal damage,
bypassing the skin barrier, which is a huge blockage of skin penetration of
drugs. This makes this device an ideal transdermal drug delivery system.
