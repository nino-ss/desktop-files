２. Product (item name) Overview purpose of Use 
. Product Overview 
 
This product is a disposable medicine direct injection device that injects medicines into the 
human body by connecting a connector to the articulated arm of the laser surgical machine and 
connecting a disposable syringe. 
It is a mechanism for penetrating the medicine into the skin by focusing and exploding the laser 
into the liquid inside the cylinder to generate an instantaneous pressure, and then injecting the 
medicine in the chamber in the form of fine particles by the expansion of the elastic membrane.
