Best wavelengths 
“When it comes to patient results, the Dynamis’ 
Er:YAG and Nd:YAG have proven to be, for me, 
the best wavelengths to minimize complications 
and shorten recovery times while providing

The Fotona proprietary Er:YAG laser
Er:YAG 
Er:YAG laser utilizes a unique wavelength that is absorbed within a few microns of 
tissue, thus avoiding any damage to deeper-lying tissues.
VSP 
VSP technology enables the operator to easily adjust the laser treatment modality from 
micro–short (MSP) to extra–long (XLP) pulses in order to precisely balance the removal 
of epidermis with thermal effects on collagen.
Key Features:
P Superior absorption 
P Most efficient ablation
P VSP to control the ablation/
coagulation ratio
P From mild–cold to deep–hot 
ablation
P Full beam and fractional 
resurfacing
P Special TURBO and 
SMOOTH® mode
Versatility of Treatments
P From light–cold to deep–
warm peels
P Fractional treatments 
P SMOOTH® mode
“
The Ideal balance between efficiency and downtime, with the lowest risk of PIH
“Dynamis Er:YAG is a very effective tool for resurfacing treatments, in terms of the balance between 
efficiency and downtime, with the lowest risk of PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation).”

Non–ablative VSP Er:YAG is a unique modality 
for non–invasive thermal–only treatments.
Ideal For Non–Ablative Er:YAG Skin 
Resurfacing 
SMOOTH® Mode enables non-ablative laser skin 
remodeling based on controlled induction of thermal 
injury of the collagen while preserving the epidermis. 
In addition to an immediate effect resulting in the 
shrinkage of collagen fibers, the initiation of neo-
collagenesis occurs causing the generation of new 
collagen. The effects result in an overall improvement of 
laxity and elasticity in the treated tissue.

SMOOTH® Mode 
Treats the skin in a smooth, almost “feather-like” non-ablative 
manner, without bleeding and with precisely controlled 
temperature deposition. The optical energy is delivered in 
a unique, sub-second long pulse sequence which prevents 
temperature build-up at the surface and achieves homogeneous 
heating within several hundred micrometers of the tissue.

A NON-ABLATIVE FOTONA SMOOTH® 
MODE TREATMENT FOR TIGHTENING OF 
THE PERIOCULAR REGION 
SmoothEyeTM treatment reduces the appearance 
of periorbital wrinkles from the inside out, which 
significantly tightens loose and aging skin of the eyelids 
and periocular region with little-to-no downtime and 
maximum patient comfort, making this a very sought 
after non-invasive cosmetic procedure. After a few 
treatment sessions, the result is improved skin elasticity, 
overall structure, and volume with significant wrinkle 
reduction in the periocular region.
The PS03 handpiece is a variable spot size handpiece, 
with fixed pixel-size, independent of the selected spot 
size. Spot sizes range from 2 to 7 mm with a fixed pixel 
structure within the laser spot; when the spot size is 
changed, the number of pixels inside the spot changes.
“
A breakthrough treatment
“It works extremely well. Reducing eye bags 
usually requires invasive surgery and there are 
side effects. The advantage of this laser-based 
approach is the non-invasive aspect, which 
can reduce eye bags safely. This is really a 
breakthrough treatment that is unlike anything 
we have seen before for this indication.”
